<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>POLLIO AND POSY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were seven Pitchers in the family,—Judge
Pitcher and his wife and five children;
but, as the twins were the youngest
of all, they were often called “the Little
Pitchers.”</p>

<p>They were Flaxie Frizzle’s cousins; and
the more I think about them, the more I
think I will try to put them into a story.
They lived so far away from New York, that
Flaxie had never seen, and had scarcely ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
heard of them. Their home was in a town
we will call Rosewood, on the banks of a
beautiful river, and so high up that the air
was very pure and cool; only it did not
seem like living on a hill, for, as far as you
could see, the whole country looked nearly
as flat as a table.</p>

<p>The twins were four years old. I don’t
mean that was always their age; but they
were four when our story begins. If you
had looked in the great gilt-edged family
Bible on the parlor-table, you would have
seen that their whole names were Napoleon
Bonaparte Pitcher, and Josephine Bonaparte
Pitcher; but it did no great harm, for nobody
called them any thing worse than
Pollio and Posy.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t fink we’re twins,” said Pollio,
the boy; “I fink we’re <i>odds</i>. We don’t look
any bit alike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>And they didn’t. Strangers often asked
if Pollio belonged to the family; for he
looked like a French boy, with his straight
dark hair, brown eyes, and brown skin.
Posy’s hair fell in golden curls; her eyes
were blue, and her face very fair. Pollio
was so homely and funny that it made you
laugh; and she was so beautiful that it
made you smile.</p>

<p>They had two high chairs exactly alike;
only Pollio had rubbed the arms of his with
his elbows, and scratched them sadly with
his fork.</p>

<p>They had each a fur cap and tippet to
wear in the winter; only Posy kept hers on
a nail, and Pollio threw his down wherever
he happened to be.</p>

<p>No, they were not “any bit alike;” but
what loving little friends they were, and how
gayly they did trudge about the grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
at home, and up and down the village street,
with their arms around each other’s waists!
The neighbors came to the windows of their
houses as the little couple passed by, saying,
“See those little Pitchers! Don’t they look
like Tom Thumb and his wife?” When
people spoke to them, Posy dropped her
eyes, and blushed; but Pollio held up his
head, and made answer for both.</p>

<p>Once, in the winter, when they were going
out walking, and Posy was half stifled with
her fur cap and a big comforter wound twice
round her neck, Pollio said,—</p>

<p>“She wants to walk <i>sturbously</i> free, and
not be mumbled up.”</p>

<p>“Sturbously” was one of his big words
that mamma had to guess at; but she unwound
the comforter, and Pollio said,—</p>

<p>“Fank you. It’s awful mild, and she
fought she’d choke. Good-by now: we’re
going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Posy would never have complained of
the comforter; but she has a brother who is
always ready to scold for her,” said mamma,
looking fondly after her darlings.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be afraid; there sha’n’t any
dogs hurt <i>you</i>,” she heard him say to his
timid little sister, as Dr. Field’s Fido barked
at their heels.</p>

<p>He often promised to protect his mother
and his aunt Ann from the same dog, and
from all the horses in town; for Pollio was
a very brave boy.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, General Pollio! Good-morning,
Mrs. <i>Posio!</i> Guess what I’ve got
in my jug,” called out Bobby Thatcher.</p>

<p>So of course the children followed him;
and when they came home from their walk,
instead of being “mumbled up,” Pollio had
left his ulster at Mrs. Thatcher’s, and his
jacket was sticky with maple-sirup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“What <i>did</i> you wipe your hands on?”
asked aunt Ann.</p>

<p>“On my apron.” But looking down, and
seeing he wore none, he added promptly,
“<i>If I’d had one on.</i>”</p>

<p>Aunt Ann laughed, and “hoped he had
not been teasing the neighbors for something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“What you s’pose?” cried Pollio indignantly.
“I only told Mrs. Fatcher, ‘Oh,
<i>dear</i>, we’re so hunger-y!’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher spoiled the twins a little;
and so, I fear, did most of the neighbors, as
well as the family at home; but they <i>did</i>
have such a good time in this bright, fresh,
beautiful world! Pollio had what his uncle
Rufus called “a strong sense of the funny,”
and could imitate all sorts of noises. He
could crow, bark, and mew, and even bray
like a donkey. Teddy, the boy next older,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was handsomer and behaved better; but
Posy thought the sun never shone on a boy
so bright as “her Pollio.”</p>

<p>Their papa was gone from home a great
deal, attending court. The twins had no
idea what a court might be; but Pollio
“fought” it was some kind of a store, for
papa always came home from it with his
pockets full of presents. He was a great
fleshy man, a little gray and a little bald,
with the most winning smile around the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p>He liked to see his children all about him
when he was at home; so he would not stay
up stairs in his study, but wrote every evening
at the parlor-table between the two
front-windows. Nunky—that was uncle
Rufus Gilman—sat in the corner, reading;
Nanty—that was aunt Ann Pitcher—sat
by a little basket-table, sewing; Edith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Dick—the older brother and sister—pretended
to study; and mamma—well, mamma
spent half her time keeping the three youngest
children away from papa’s inkstand.</p>

<p>One evening Pollio got down on all-fours,
put up his back, and hissed like a cat. His
father only laughed till he hit the table and
upset the inkstand, and then he had to be
sent out of the room. Posy begged to go
too: she always wanted to be punished with
Pollio.</p>

<p>Eliza Potter, the cook, was washing dishes
when they came into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“O you little witch, quit that!” said she
to Pollio, as he began to build houses with
the knives and forks.</p>

<p>It always amused him to hear her say
“Quit that!” and to see her wink her eyelashes.
The more she scolded, the faster she
winked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Next evening Pollio was noisy again in the
parlor; but nobody minded it till he said,—</p>

<p>“Don’t you see I’m naughty, mamma?
Why don’t you send me out in the kitchen?”</p>

<p>He wanted to tease Eliza again; but his
mother punished him this time by sending
him to bed. It seemed pretty hard; for he
was very wide awake, and, though not afraid,
found it rather lonesome without his bed-fellow,
Teddy. In a few moments he was
heard screaming, and his mother ran up to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“O Lord! I’m a poor little boy all alone
in the dark. Do send me a la-amp, a la-amp,
a <i>la-amp!</i>”</p>

<p>“Pollio!” exclaimed his mother as soon
as she could reach his chamber.</p>

<p>“Why, mamma,” said he, looking up in
her face very innocently, “I was only <i>praying!</i>
You want me to pray, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma told Nunky afterwards that she
did not know what to say to her queer little
boy. He and Posy both had such strange
ideas about God, that she wished Nunky
would talk with them some time and try to
make them understand who He is and why
we should pray to Him.</p>

<p>Nunky said, perhaps they were too
young; but he would do the best he could.
He was like a father to them when their own
father was gone. He was quite a young
man, and an artist. And here I will stop a
moment, and tell you more about him.</p>

<p>He had a room at the very top of the
house, called a studio; and you climbed some
crooked stairs to reach it. He spent all his
mornings in this room, with the door locked
but once or twice the twins had peeped in
and seen him sitting before a great easel
painting pictures. He wore a gray dressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gown, and velvet cap with a tassel; and the
sun poured straight down on his head
through a hole in the roof.</p>

<p>“Ho yo! that’s jolly!” shouted Pollio.</p>

<p>Instantly the door was shut in his face.
So unkind of Nunky! The twins wouldn’t
have meddled with his paints, of course:
hadn’t they <i>told</i> him they wouldn’t meddle?</p>

<p>“If we once got in, he’d want us to stay:
he finks <i>everyfing</i> of us,” said Pollio to Posy.</p>

<p>“Let’s get in,” said she.</p>

<p>So one day they crept up stairs and
knocked. Posy had her doll, and Pollio his
drum; for they meant to make it very
pleasant for Nunky.</p>

<p>Knock! knock!</p>

<p>“We won’t be <i>sturbous!</i>” said Pollio.</p>

<p>“Can’t we come in a tinty minute?”
pleaded Posy, fumbling at the keyhole; while
Pollio’s drum tumbled down stairs, rattlety
bang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of answering, Nunky growled like
a bear, and roared like a lion; and they
were obliged to go at last; for they might
have stood all day without getting in.
Nunky was a man that couldn’t be coaxed.</p>

<p>But that very evening, when his work was
done, he was perfectly lovely, and played for
them on his flute. The tune Pollio liked
best was “The Shepherd’s Pipe upon the
Mountain.” He thought it was a meerschaum
like papa’s, and the shepherd was
smoking it as he drove his sheep along.
Nunky forgot to say he was making his flute
sound like a <i>bagpipe</i>.</p>

<p>But the tune Posy liked best was “The
Mother’s Prayer,” low and faint at first, then
growing clearer and sweeter.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, what does it make you
think of?” said Nunky as she sat on his
knee, her wee hands folded, and her eyes
raised to his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Makes me fink of the heaven-folks,”
replied she solemnly. “I wish little Alice
would come down here and live again. Me
and Pollio, we’d be very glad.”</p>

<p>Alice was a little sister she had never seen.</p>

<p>“I’ve asked God to send her down,” said
Pollio; “but He won’t. I sha’n’t pray to
God any more. <i>You</i> may if you want to,
Posy; but <i>I</i> sha’n’t. I keep a-talkin’, and
He don’t say a word.”</p>

<p>Now was the time for Nunky to tell them
something about God; but what should he
say? What could they understand?</p>

<p>“God does speak to you, Pollio: not in
words; but he speaks to your <i>heart</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh! does He? I know where my heart
is,—right here under my jag-knife pocket.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is a voice in there sometimes,
that tells you when you do wrong.”</p>

<p>“Is there?—-Put your ear down, Posy.
Can you hear anyfing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” said Nunky, trying not to
smile: “the voice isn’t heard; it is <i>felt</i>.
Tell me, little ones, don’t you <i>feel</i> sorry
when you do wrong?”</p>

<p>“When I get sent to bed I do,” said
Pollio.</p>

<p>“Once I felt awful bad when I fell down
cellar,” remarked Posy.</p>

<p>Nunky smiled outright then, and had a
great mind not to say any more; but he did
so wish to plant a seed of truth in these
little minds!</p>

<p>“Was it right, Pollio, to take those tarts
yesterday without leave?”</p>

<p>The little boy hung his head, and wondered
how Nunky knew about that.</p>

<p>“Didn’t something tell you it was wrong?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” whispered Pollio faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, that was God’s voice. He spoke
to your heart then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Pollio began to understand.</p>

<p>“That is the way He speaks. Now, I don’t
want to hear you say again, ‘I keep a-talkin’
and a-talkin’, and He don’t say a word.’”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” said Pollio, his brown face
lighting up. “He whispers right under your
pocket. I’m going to pray some more now:
I’d just as lief pray as not.”</p>

<p>“So’d I,” said Posy. “But I sha’n’t ask
him to ‘bless papa and mamma, and <i>everybody</i>,’
’cause I don’t want him to bless the
naughty Indians; do <i>you</i>, Nunky?”</p>

<p>“Ask him to make them good,” replied
Nunky, stroking the little golden head, and
wondering how much Posy understood of
what he had been saying.</p>

<p>“Well, I will. I love God and the angels
better’n I do you, Nunky. Of course I
<i>ought</i> to love the heaven-folks best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does God do just what you ask him to
when you pray?” said Pollio, who had been
for some moments lost in thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, if He thinks it best, he does.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I sha’n’t say, ‘Accept me
through thy Son;’ for the <i>sun</i> is too hot:
I’d rather go through the <i>moon</i>.”</p>

<p>Nunky had to turn his head away to
laugh. He did not try in the least to explain
any thing more to Pollio that evening,
and he really thought all his words had been
thrown away. But this was a mistake. A
new idea had entered the children’s minds,—an
idea they would never forget. Nunky
found this out a long while afterward, and
was very glad he had taken so much pains.</p>

<p>But just now he had talked long enough;
so he dropped the children from his knee
suddenly, pretending he hadn’t known they
were there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“What! <i>you</i> here, little Pitchers? Off
with you this minute!—Oh, no! come back:
you haven’t thanked me for the music.”</p>

<p>Nunky was careful of their manners; but
I think, too, he had “a strong sense of the
funny” as well as Pollio, and enjoyed
seeing his nephew pull his front-hair and
make a bow; while Posy dropped a deep,
deep courtesy, and they both lisped out,—</p>

<p>“Fank you, Nunky.”</p>

<p>You know, Pollio’s hair was uncommonly
straight and black, and he twitched it as if
he were pulling a bell-rope; and Posy, being
rather fat, bounced up and down like a rubber
ball.</p>

<p>I am sure their uncle made them say
“Fank you” when there wasn’t the least
need of it, just to see how comical they
looked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>GOING TO SCHOOL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the twins were five years old, they
began to go to school.</p>

<p>As they were trudging along with Teddy
and the dog on the first morning, feeling
very happy and very important, Edith called
aunt Ann to see how cunning they looked,—Posy
in a white frock and sun-bonnet;
and Pollio all in blue, with a white sailor-hat.
Posy had curled some dandelion-stems,
and Teddy had tied them to the dog’s ears;
so Beppo was as fine as the twins.</p>

<p>Dr. Field met the merry party on the
street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-morning, little <i>twimlings!</i> Going
to school? Well, don’t be <i>sturbous</i>, my
dears.”</p>

<p>Pollio pulled Posy along with a jerk.</p>

<p>“Oh! give my regards to the family when
you go home, and tell your mamma I disapprove
of your studying too hard.”</p>

<p>Pollio ran faster yet. He never could see
the least fun in the doctor’s jokes.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was a large brick building,
half a mile away; and the teacher
seemed very glad to see the twins (of course
they knew she would be), and she let them
sit together. They liked it extremely, till
Pollio happened to observe that he was one
boy in the midst of forty girls: whereupon
he stalked out to Miss Chase, and said with
great dignity,—</p>

<p>“If you’ll scuse me, I want to sit the way
the other folks do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Chase smiled, and seated him beside
Jamie Cushing (a boy of eight), and Posy
beside a lame girl of seven. Pollio liked
Jamie, because he had a pop-gun in his desk,
and promised to show him at recess how to
fire it off. Posy liked <i>her</i> seat-mate, because
she had a very sweet face, and because she
hopped on one foot, and dragged the other
as a tired bird does; but her clothes were
very ragged.</p>

<p>“I know who you are: you are Posy
Pitcher.”</p>

<p>Posy nodded.</p>

<p>“And I’m Lucinda Outhouse.”</p>

<p>“Oh! are you? And does your mamma
know you have such big holes in your clo’es,
<i>Lucy-vindy?</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh! this woman I live with isn’t my
mamma: my mamma’s dead.”</p>

<p>Posy looked sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“My papa died first, and my mamma
married me another papa; and then my
mamma died, and <i>he</i> married me another
<i>mamma</i>. But <i>she</i> don’t belong to me, and
<i>he</i> don’t belong to me; and I haven’t any
papa and mamma.”</p>

<p>Posy could not understand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you live anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they let me live with ’em; but they
don’t like me. Don’t cry, darling,” added
<i>Lucy-vindy</i> with a smile and nod: “God’ll
take care o’ <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! He’s one o’ that kind that don’t
have anyfing to do but take care o’ folks,”
said Posy, her face brightening.</p>

<p>And then her class was called. How her
little heart beat under her white frock! and
how the blushes came in her soft cheeks!
She could hardly read above her breath; but
Pollio, who had never been to school before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
any more than she had, and didn’t know
quite so much, poked her with his elbow,
and whispered, “What you ’fraid of?”
And, when his turn came, he read so loud,
you could have heard him in the street.</p>

<p>“Well, how do you like it, my dears?”
asked papa at night.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s the best teacher <i>I</i> ever had!”
said Pollio promptly.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Have you learned any thing
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Posy, eager to speak:
“<i>the world walks!</i>”</p>

<p>“You know what she means; ‘the earth
moves,’” laughed Teddy. “She heard ’em
say that in the jography-class.”</p>

<p>Posy could see no difference between
walking and moving; but she did wish
Teddy wouldn’t laugh at every thing she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Papa shook his head at Teddy, and went
on questioning Posy, who sat on his knee.</p>

<p>“Did my little girl whisper in school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: once or twice or <i>three</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh my! I should think”—</p>

<p>“Hush, Teddy! Did you carry your slate,
Pollio?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and I can make pictures better’n
any of ’em.”</p>

<p>His father presumed this was true; for
Pollio’s drawings were rather remarkable
for a small child.</p>

<p>“And I draw horses for the fellow that
sits with me. He’s a jolly boy,—fires ’tatoes
out of a gun.”</p>

<p>“Well, the girl with me hops lame,” said
Posy, determined not to be outdone by
Pollio. “She’s a <i>hypocrite</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Cripple!</i>” explained Teddy.</p>

<p>“I think it must be the little girl I meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on the street so often,” said Nunky. “I
call her ‘Hop-clover.’ She has a very sweet
face.”</p>

<p>“Her father’s an awful drunkard,” remarked
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t her truly papa, and she
hasn’t any truly mamma. Her name’s <i>Lucy-vindy</i>,
and she hasn’t anybody to take care
of her but just God. I wish I could give
her my pink dress,” begged Posy.</p>

<p>“We will see about that,” said mamma.</p>

<p>Next day it “rained so hard, the water
couldn’t catch its breath;” but the little
Pitchers were so eager for school, that their
mother let them go. They marched off very
proudly under an umbrella; while Teddy
walked before them with the books, and
Beppo behind with the dinner-pail.</p>

<p>“Hop-clover” carried her dinner too; but
at noon, when she saw Posy giving Beppo a
piece of cold lamb, she thought,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ’most wish I was Posy Pitcher’s dog, so
she’d give <i>me</i> some meat.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your dinner?” said Posy.</p>

<p>“Hop-clover” spread it out then on her
desk, looking ashamed as she did so; for it
was nothing but dry bread and <i>very</i> dried
apple-pie. Posy thought that was what came
of having such a queer mother that <i>wasn’t</i>
a mother; and offered her new friend an
orange.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you ever so much!” said
Hop-clover, her sad eyes sparkling. “I’ve
seen oranges lots of times, but I never ate
one before.”</p>

<p>Posy looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“What a baby that is!” thought Jimmy
Cushing, spying Posy’s innocent face just
then as he came along, swinging his arms, and
whistling. “Guess I’ll plague her a little.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is that you, Posy Pitcher?” said he
aloud. “Well, I’ve got something for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>She blushed and smiled.</p>

<p>“Put out your hand,” said he, offering her
a clam. “There, just feel of that: isn’t it
smooth? Put your fingers inside.”</p>

<p>She knew no better than to do as he
said; and the clam, which was alive, knew
no better than to seize her little hand with
a dreadful grip. Dear little Posy screamed
fearfully, and some of the larger boys had
to come in and break the clam-shell with
a hammer before her hand was set free.</p>

<p>Pollio knew nothing about it till it was
all over, and he found her drying her eyes
on Addie Thatcher’s neck.</p>

<p>“Hurt you bad, dear?” asked he tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it did; and that boy <i>saw</i> how I
cried. Why, I cried awf’lly!”</p>

<p>The angry brother clinched his fists, and
ran to find Jimmy. He did not stop to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
think of Jimmy’s age and size, but rushed
at him wildly, exclaiming, “Take <i>that</i>
for ’busing my sister!”</p>

<p>It was the last sentence Pollio spoke for
five minutes. How <i>could</i> he speak, with
Jimmy’s foot on his back, and his own face
close to the earth, eating dirt? It was as
much as <i>he</i> could do to breathe.</p>

<p>“Want to whip me <i>again</i>, my son? I’m
ready for you!” called out that dreadful
Jimmy with a gay laugh.</p>

<p>Wasn’t it hateful, when Pollio couldn’t
hurt him any more than a fly at the best of
times, and needed both hands now to stop
the nose-bleed?</p>

<p>Pollio ran home in a fever of rage; but
when the rain had cooled him a little he
dreaded to see his mother, and let her know
he had been quarrelling.</p>

<p>His aunt Ann met him at the door with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a look of amazement; for he had no umbrella,
his clothes were soaking with water,
and the handkerchief he held to his nose
was red with blood.</p>

<p>“Fought I’d come home,” stammered he,
darting into the entry. “Dr. Field sent
his ’gards to you, Nanty.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t come home in the rain to
tell me that? How <i>did</i> you get hurt so,
my child?”</p>

<p>Pollio wondered how she knew he was
hurt, when he hadn’t told her a word.</p>

<p>“Dr. Field <i>did</i> sent his ’gards to you,
Nanty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“And he sent his ’gards to Nunky, and
he sent ’em to the whole fam-i-ly.”</p>

<p>The last word ended in a wail. His nose
did ache so! and—oh, dear!—it was bleeding
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Ann screamed for his mother. He
had taken away the handkerchief, and revealed
the worst-looking nose you ever saw
on a human boy. She thought it was
broken, but it was not.</p>

<p>“Jimmy Cushion did that,—the boy I
liked that had a pop-gun,” said Pollio after
his mother had bathed his face with arnica,
and asked him fifty questions.</p>

<p>“What! that large boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes: he’ll be nine years old ’fore I am,”
said little Pollio.</p>

<p>“Several years before. Of course, my
dear, you had done something to Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“No, mamma. You see, I tried to; but I
couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Tried to! What made you try, my
son?”</p>

<p>“Why, you s’pose I’m going to let him
’buse my little sister,—nipping up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hands like a pair o’ tongs with a pair
o’ clams?”</p>

<p>“Oh! was that it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pitcher couldn’t help hugging Pollio;
for he didn’t seem to mind his own sufferings
when he thought of his precious Posy.</p>

<p>“Well, my son, if Jimmy pinched her,
that was wrong. I like to see you so ready
to protect your sister; but you needn’t fly at
anybody like a little savage. I <i>can’t</i> have
my darling boy fight!”</p>

<p>Pollio buried his aching nose in his
mother’s bosom. He didn’t want to fight
again that day, you may be sure.</p>

<p>It was a whole week before he could go
to school again; for his nose was hideous.
It was red, blue, green, and yellow; and
Nunky said nobody could get an education
who looked like that.</p>

<p>Posy would not go without her brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and mourned very much because people
laughed at him.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry about <i>me</i>,” said Pollio: “I’m
only a boy! If ’twas a girl, ’twould be
awful!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>“THE FINNY-CASTICS.”</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pollio</span> didn’t learn much during his first
term at school, except mischief. He learned
to whoop like a wild Indian, and stand on
his head like the clown at a circus. Eliza
said that whoop was “enough to split her
ears in two,” and he never entered the house
without it.</p>

<p>But it was midsummer now, and vacation
had begun. Fourth of July was coming;
and Judge Pitcher, before going away to
attend court, had bought Teddy and Pollio
a good supply of pin-wheels and fire-crackers.
Posy did not fancy such noisy playthings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and he had given <i>her</i> some money to buy
“Hop-clover” a dress.</p>

<p>It would not be the Fourth till to-morrow;
but Pollio had fired off nearly all his
crackers, and was now frightening Posy by
climbing the ridge-pole of the barn. While
she was running back and forth, clasping her
hands, and begging him to come down, their
kind old Quaker friend, Mr. Littlefield, drove
up to the gate.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry!” cried Posy: “the <i>Earthquake’s</i>
coming.”</p>

<p>The Quaker laughed to hear himself called
an <i>earthquake:</i> though he did shake the
floor a little when he walked; for he was a
fleshy man,—as large as Judge Pitcher.</p>

<p>“How does thee do, Josephine?” said he,
patting her curls as he entered the yard.
“Where’s thy little brother?”</p>

<p>Then, spying him on the roof of the barn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he exclaimed, “Napoleon, Napoleon, come
down here! Thee shouldn’t play the monkey
like that!”</p>

<p>“Napoleon” obeyed quickly.</p>

<p>“Now tell me what makes thee climb such
high places? Thee’ll break thy neck yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I told Posy I was going to; and you
wouldn’t have me tell her a lie, would you?”
replied Pollio with a very serious face.</p>

<p>The Quaker would not allow himself to
smile at this. “Is thy mother willing to
have thee do so?”</p>

<p>Pollio knew she was not; and he hung his
head, and began to beat the dirt in the road
with a stick. He was very fond of Mr. Littlefield,
and did not like to have the good
man know he ever did wrong.</p>

<p>“Stop, my son! Is it possible thee kills
snakes?”</p>

<p>For Pollio was crushing a little snake with
his stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir: ’twas dead in the first place, and
I just killed it a little more.”</p>

<p>The Quaker smiled, and went into the
house with the children. He staid to tea;
and at the table he observed once or twice
that Pollio did not obey his mother the very
moment she spoke, and he feared his little
pet was growing naughty. “Napoleon,” said
he, as the little boy came skipping out
after supper to see him mount his horse. (He
would never call him Pollio, though he disliked
his real name, for “Napoleon Bonaparte
was a fighting-man.”) “Napoleon!”</p>

<p>“Sir?” said Pollio.</p>

<p>“Thee is a great favorite of mine, Napoleon;
but I have a word to say against thy
conduct to-day.”</p>

<p>Pollio cast down his eyes. Mr. Littlefield
was an old-fashioned man, who did not use
very good grammar; but everybody loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
him dearly, and Pollio would rather have
been chidden by almost any one else.</p>

<p>“Thee has one of the best mothers that
ever lived, my boy. I want thee always to
mind thy mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And remember this: A child that won’t
mind its mother won’t mind its God!”</p>

<p>“Click, clack,” went the horse’s hoofs;
and Pollio stood on the fence till horse and
rider were far out of sight. Still these words
rang in his ears:—</p>

<p>“A child that won’t mind its mother won’t
mind its God.”</p>

<p>Next morning he and Teddy were wakened
by the firing of guns; and both sprang
out of bed with a bound, and Pollio with a
“whoop.” He had a new “pair o’ clo’es,”
which he was not to wear till next Sunday;
but I grieve to say, that, thinking he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
not do too much for his country, he put
them on, and ran down stairs after Teddy.</p>

<p>Posy, who slept in the next room with
Edith, wished also to do something for her
country, but fell asleep, and forgot it.</p>

<p>The two boys rushed out of doors as if
there were no time to be lost; but it was so
very early that nobody was to be seen but
Beppo, and Muff the gray cat, whose tail had
a yellow tip, as if it had been scorched. The
village-boys, who had been firing guns and
ringing bells, had gone to bed to make up
their sleep; and there was no sound now
except from time to time the crowing of a
cock, or the braying of Judge Pitcher’s donkey,
which Pollio called by mistake “the
Yankee.”</p>

<p>There were “fairies’ tablecloths” on the
grass,—I mean spiders’ webs,—covered
with dew: the flowers hung their heads, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the trees hardly stirred. The world did not
look natural to the two little boys at this
early hour.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in the barn and take a nap,”
yawned Teddy, not half as wide awake as
his brother.</p>

<p>“How now, boys? what makes you so
sober?” called out somebody from the
piazza. “Come up here and see what I’ve
got for you.”</p>

<p>The words were very refreshing; but at
the same time Nunky let fly three beautiful
red, white, and blue balloons, the largest and
gayest ever seen.</p>

<p>Teddy was as wide awake now as Pollio,
and cut as many capers of delight.</p>

<p>“So you like them, do you?” laughed
Nunky. “They are for you and Posy, from
your ‘thee-and-thou friend.’”</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s the goodest man that ever
lived, ’cept you!” shouted Pollio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t you say thank you?”</p>

<p>“Fank you,” said Pollio with a fearful
pull at his front-hair; and over he went in a
somerset.</p>

<p>The strings were long, and the balloons
flew up like birds into the morning sky.</p>

<p>“Oh, if they had only made such things
when I was a boy! It’s sad to think how
much I’ve lost!” said Nunky with a make-believe
sigh.</p>

<p>Pollio was very sorry for his uncle. It
must be hard to grow up and not care for
balloons! Nunky would never, never, be
a boy again: his good times were over.</p>

<p>“Poor Nunky! He has got to stay old,”
thought Pollio as the young man walked
into the house with a bounding step.</p>

<p>He was very far from old, and, as for
good times, felt much happier than either
of his little nephews, if they had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
known it. Teddy had gone in swimming
the day before without leave, and naughty
Pollio had just got a grass stain on the
knees of his new “pair o’ clo’es;” so how
could either of the boys be quite happy?</p>

<p>When they went in to breakfast, their
mother and aunt Ann were talking about
the Fantastics.</p>

<p>“Billy Barstow and a few other wild
boys are to ride colts and mules,” said
aunt Ann; “and I’m afraid somebody
will get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! everybody will keep out of
the way,” returned uncle Rufus. “The
Fantastics will pass by at eight o’clock,
and then the danger will be over.”</p>

<p>“I want to see the ‘Finny-castics,’” said
Pollio, flourishing his fork.</p>

<p>“Do you know what they are, General?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Wigs on their faces, and
things; but they won’t scare <i>me</i> a bit!”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t scare you if you stand
close by Nunky or me,” said mamma; “but
you must keep out of the streets.”</p>

<p>“Now, little ones,” added she, holding up
a warning finger as they all left the table,
“I have your father’s orders that you are
not to go off the grounds to-day, or even
out of the yard, without leave. You can
see the Fantastics from the fence perfectly
well; but remember you are not to go into
the street, Pollio. Do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma.”</p>

<p>He rushed past her as he spoke, lest she
should see his Sunday clothes. He had
heard all she said, and fully intended to
obey; but what he wanted just now was
to teach Posy to fly her new balloon.</p>

<p>She was quite as pleased with it as he
had expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which do you love best, Posy,—Nunky,
or the thee-and-thou man?”</p>

<p>“Which gave me the b’loon?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Littlefield.”</p>

<p>“Then I love <i>him</i> best.”</p>

<p>As the gay toys rose higher and higher,
she thought how her angel sister Alice
would like them, and wondered if this
wasn’t a good time to send her a present.</p>

<p>Pollio thought not. He didn’t believe
they could find a string in town long
enough to reach to heaven.</p>

<p>“Why Posy,” said he with some contempt
for her ignorance, “heaven’s the
other side the moon: it’s more’n twenty
miles off.”</p>

<p>Posy gave it up then: twenty miles was
too far. And she was rather glad she need
not part with her balloon, even to the
“heaven-folks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>In talking, Pollio, who always flourished
his arms a great deal, had let go the
string; and now his balloon had flown up,
up, out of reach. Oh, dear! It seemed so
glad to go, like a bird let out of a cage!
How far would it fly? Pollio forgot entirely
that he was forbidden to leave the
yard, and darted out, leaving little Posy
gazing up, half hoping the baby would get
a present, after all.</p>

<p>The balloon was a long time in coming
down; but Pollio found it at last sticking
fast to the top of the fence on the other
side of the street, quarter of a mile from
home. It was entirely ruined, of course.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” sighed he, surveying
it mournfully.</p>

<p>In climbing back over the sharp-pointed
fence, he tore his new clothes badly; but
by that time bugles and tin horns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sounding in the distance, and he could see
a moving black mass, which he knew must
be the Fantastics.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll stay here and watch ’em
come up,” thought he, rubbing the dirt off
his knees. “Oh, but mamma said I
mustn’t!” was his next thought.</p>

<p>“There! God spoke to me then!” whispered
he to himself with a look of awe; for
he had never forgotten Nunky’s talk about
“God’s voice.” “<i>He</i> spoke to me then: I
<i>felt</i> him speak!”</p>

<p>Pollio stood for a moment with his hand
on his “jag-knife pocket.” So far, he had
not meant to do wrong. He had run out
of the yard and down the street without
once thinking of his mother’s warning, and,
if he would go back now, she was sure to
forgive him. But <i>would</i> he go back?</p>

<p>He looked down the street. The Fantastics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
were so near by this time, that he
could discern the horses. Wouldn’t it be
fun to wait till they came in sight, and
then throw up his cap and shout!</p>

<p>“Poh! anybody must be a baby to be
afraid of the ‘Finny-castics’! Mamma fought
I’d better stay side of <i>her!</i>” Then he
remembered Mr. Littlefield’s words: “The
child that won’t mind its mother won’t
mind its God;” and there was another
thump under the “jag-knife pocket.”</p>

<p>He knew very well he ought to run back
to the house before the “Finny-castics” got
any nearer; but the noise of the trumpets
and tin pans was so lively, that it set his feet
dancing, and his arms flying. He could see
his mother and all the rest of the family in
the front-yard; though they could not see
him, for he was hidden by a clump of trees
and a bend in the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t stop—yes, I will! I’ll go home—no,
I won’t!”</p>

<p>Thus his thoughts swung back and forth;
and, before he had made up his mind
whether to stay or not, he <i>had</i> staid, and
the “Finny-castics,” with their horses and
mules, were close at hand.</p>

<p>Pollio had seen the same sight the year
before, but not so near; oh, not <i>half</i> so
near! And weren’t they awful?</p>

<p>They did not look like men, but like all
sorts of horrid creatures that you dream
of at night, after eating too much supper.
Some wore coats and hats; and some wore
gowns and bonnets, with paper flowers the
size of dinner-plates, and bunches of feathers
as big as brooms.</p>

<p>But it was not the dress Pollio minded, so
much as the faces. How they did stare at
him, and grin at him, those faces!—with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
mouths wide enough to take him right in,
with monstrous noses, puffed cheeks, glaring
eyes,—white faces, yellow faces, monkey’s
faces, and faces as black as a shoe.</p>

<p>Pollio knew that these were all masks, or
what he called “wigs,” and that they were
worn by harmless Rosewood boys, who did
it only for fun. Pollio knew this well
enough. But you can’t always recollect all
you know: you hardly ever can when you
are taken by surprise. Before he stopped
to think, he screamed; but, after he had
screamed, he laughed to think how silly it
was.</p>

<p>“Poh, nothing but <i>wigs!</i> Glad Posy isn’t
here. Guess <i>she’d</i> be scared!”</p>

<p>While he stood trembling and gazing, he
saw an object that fairly made his hair stand
on end. It was Billy Barstow, with a wolf’s
head on his shoulders, and on the head a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ruffled cap. It was the very image of the
wolf that ate up Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p>Billy was seated on a frisky colt that
wouldn’t walk soberly along with the horses
and mules, but danced round and round on
one side of the procession. Pollio never
thought of being afraid of the colt; but the
wolf with the frilled cap on was fearful.</p>

<p>“Rum te dum diddlety dum! Hullo, my
little man! Get up here and ride?” cried
the wolf, shaking his cap-strings, opening
his jaws, and showing his long white teeth.</p>

<p>Pollio knew it wasn’t a wolf; for it
drummed with its hands on a tin pan.
But, oh, it did <i>seem</i> awful! It seemed exactly
like <i>the</i> wolf that pretended to be Red
Riding Hood’s grandmother; and, if poor
Red Riding Hood felt much worse than
Pollio, I am sorry for her.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! lemme ’lone!” screamed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
little fellow, running, or trying to run;
for he was in such a panic that his legs
hardly moved, except to tremble.</p>

<p>Instead of being sorry that he had frightened
a poor little child, Billy Barstow
thought it fine sport, and turned his colt
round to chase Pollio. Cruel Billy! But
no: he did not mean to be cruel; he was
only thoughtless. Billy <i>never</i> stopped to
think.</p>

<p>The colt, as full of fun as his master,
pranced up and down, then whirled about,
reared, and planted his fore-feet upon Pollio,
who had fallen flat on the ground.</p>

<p>It was now Billy Barstow’s turn to be
frightened; for the child lay as still as if he
were dead.</p>

<p>“Help, help!” screamed Billy. But the
Fantastics had gone some distance by this
time, and were making such a din with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pans and horns, that they scarcely heard the
scream; or, if any of them did hear it, I
suppose they thought Billy was a noisy
fellow not worth minding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pitcher, aunt Ann, Nunky, and the
children, were still standing in the yard.
They had seen the colt prancing round and
round; and aunt Ann had said, “I’m so glad
none of the children are out there!” for
they all thought Pollio was in the yard.
Nobody had missed him yet, not even Posy.</p>

<p>So when they heard the wolf call out
“Help, help!” they only laughed, and
thought it was some of Billy’s nonsense.
But in half a minute more the wolf had
ridden to the gate with flying cap-ruffles, and
shouted out through his long white teeth,—</p>

<p>“Quick, quick! He’ll be dead before
you get there! And I can’t leave my colt!
Run,—run to Pollio!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Wasn’t it too bad for Billy to tell the
story in that dreadful way, especially as he
didn’t really know whether Pollio was much
hurt or not? But it was just like Billy.</p>

<p>Everybody was terribly frightened; and
Posy screamed so, that Edith had to hold
her, while the others ran as fast as they
could down the street to Pollio.</p>

<p>He was not killed: they knew that very
soon, for he cried lustily.</p>

<p>“O my precious!” said mamma, kneeling
beside him, “tell me where you are hurt.
Is it your head?”</p>

<p>But the child was too bewildered to answer.
He did not seem to know what had
happened, only it was something horrible,
and he could not stir.</p>

<p>“It’s of no use talking to him yet, sister
Frances: the first thing is to get him home,”
said Nunky. “Here, Dick, I’ll try to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
him up in my arms if you’ll help by raising
his feet.”</p>

<p>Dick did his best, but he hurt Pollio; and
aunt Ann had to take Dick’s place, because
her touch was more gentle. She and Nunky,
between them, managed somehow to
get the child home, though it was hard
work; and they were forced to walk very
slowly. Pollio groaned and sobbed all the
way.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he speak? I’m afraid his
head is hurt,” said his mother, walking beside
him very anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh! he’ll talk by and by, and tell us all
about it: he’s a little stunned now,” replied
Nunky, who never thought any thing was
quite as bad as it seemed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>NOT THE END OF IT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moment Dr. Field arrived, Pollio set
up a perfect howl. The doctor was a cross-looking
man, with black eyebrows that met
over his nose, and the children had always
been afraid of him. Pollio said once he
“couldn’t see his eyes, his <i>eye-bushes</i> were
so fick.”</p>

<p>“You need not fancy this boy’s brain is
injured,” said Dr. Field. “You see he
knows me, and dislikes me as much as ever.”</p>

<p>He smiled sadly as he spoke; for he was
sorry to be disliked.</p>

<p>“The colt has bruised his back a little;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but I cannot tell how much till he stops
screaming. I think I will go away now, and
come again when he is calmer.”</p>

<p>Everybody but mamma left the room;
and they tried to keep the house quiet, or as
quiet as they could on Fourth of July.
Billy Barstow had turned his colt into the
meadow, and was pacing the dining-room in
great distress, with no head on his shoulders
but his own. The wolf’s head was in the
stable-yard, and the dog was smelling at it,
and wondering to what tribe it belonged.</p>

<p>“How’s Pollio?” was Billy’s question of
everybody he saw. “O Eliza! mayn’t I go
up and listen at the keyhole? I want to see
if I can hear him groaning.”</p>

<p>“Hush! You’ve done enough mischief
for one day, Billy Barstow!—knocking the
senses out of that dear little innocent child!
There’s no knowing as he’ll ever speak
again,” sobbed Eliza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Billy, you mustn’t ’sturb my Pollio,”
said little Posy sternly.</p>

<p>“Come here to me, you darling precious
Posy!” said Eliza, seizing the pale child in
her arms. “Don’t you want some jelly?”</p>

<p>This was Eliza’s idea of “pacifying children.”
But Posy was too wretched to care
for jelly.</p>

<p>When Pollio had been left alone with his
mother for an hour or so, he grew calmer.
She bathed his head, but did not talk, except
to say in a soothing tone,—</p>

<p>“Poor little Pollio! Mamma’s little Pollio!”</p>

<p>“O mamma!” said he, speaking for the
first time, “I don’t feel as well as I used to.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, we all know it.”</p>

<p>“The wolf stepped on me,—with a cap
on.”</p>

<p>“The wolf was only Billy Barstow, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, but it hurt,” cried Pollio, hiding
his head in the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>When the doctor came again, he found his
little patient better than he had expected.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “we can’t tell even yet
how much his back is injured. Keep him
very quiet, and don’t let him sit up for a day
or two.”</p>

<p>“O doctor! wait a minute, doctor!” cried
Billy, catching the good man by the coat-tail
as he passed through the hall. “Is he hurt
bad? Just tell me <i>how</i> bad he’s hurt!”</p>

<p>The doctor wasn’t a very patient man,
and he fairly glared on the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t killed; but he might have
been. Don’t you ever let me hear of your
frightening a baby again, Billy Barstow.”</p>

<p>But, when Billy cried, the doctor softened
a little, and said it wasn’t so dreadful, after
all; for Pollio was likely to be quite well in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a few days. So Billy wiped his eyes, and
ran off to help about firing a cannon: but
he didn’t have as much fun as he had expected;
he had spoiled the day for himself
as well as for Pollio.</p>

<p>Poor Pollio! He lay on his white bed in
his pretty chamber, pale and fretful, seeing
no one but Nunky, aunt Ann, and mamma.</p>

<p>“I want my Posy!”</p>

<p>“No, dear: she would forget, and jump
up on the bed.”</p>

<p>“Then I want my Teddy.”</p>

<p>“See this!” said mamma: “it is a picture-book
Billy Barstow just sent you.”</p>

<p>But it happened to be the story of Red
Riding Hood; and Pollio threw away the
book with a shudder.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring in the little clock from
my room, and set it on the mantel, so he can
watch the hands,” said aunt Ann.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t hands, it’s fingers,” said Pollio,
determined not to be pleased.</p>

<p>“Well, fingers, then.”</p>

<p>Aunt Ann was a small lady, with a pleasant
voice and sweet smile. Posy looked
like her. She set the clock on the mantel;
and it was a comfort to Pollio, for it gave
him a chance to ask endless questions.</p>

<p>“What makes the long finger go faster
than the little finger? What time is it now?
What time will it be in five minutes? What
time will it be to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>Aunt Ann replied to all these foolish inquiries
very kindly, and told Mrs. Pitcher
she thought Pollio must be better, or he
would not wish to talk.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, I’m all better,” said Pollio,
his black eyes shining brightly. “My back
gave one great sting, and then stopped. Now
I want to get up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, my little love, the doctor says you
must lie still.”</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> don’t know. You didn’t tell him
’bout my fire-crackers. Got a million of ’em;
<i>must</i> fire ’em off! I don’t like Dr. Field,
with his great black eye-bushes. And it’s
Fourf of July too!”</p>

<p>Presently there was another wail. Pollio
had thought of the fireworks which were to
go up that evening from the top of Tower
Hill.</p>

<p>“Great red rockets just like stars! O
mamma! Posy’ll go, and Teddy’ll go. I
<i>must</i> put my clo’es on and get up.”</p>

<p>Nunky whispered to mamma that she
might as well let the child try to sit up, as
he probably could not do it.</p>

<p>Nunky was right. The moment Pollio was
raised in bed, his head felt very strangely.
He thought the clock and pictures began to
dance, while the bed spun round like a top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma laid his head back on the pillow,
and sponged his face with cold water; and
then the room and the things in it stood still,
and he felt better.</p>

<p>Nunky was not at all surprised to see him
so weak, but it grieved his mother. He did
not ask again to sit up, but lay twisting his
fingers, and thinking what a long day it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! what made God make me,
mamma? I’m tired of being made.”</p>

<p>Pollio knew just as well as you do that he
had been a naughty boy, and that he was
suffering for it. He disliked himself exceedingly;
and I think that was one reason he
was so cross, and begged his aunt Ann to go
away.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you willing mamma should leave
you a while, and lie down?” asked Nunky,
who saw that she looked pale.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so, if you’ll play ‘The Shepherd’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Pipe,’” replied Pollio, scowling; for he
could not bear to look pleasant a moment.</p>

<p>When he had made Nunky play “The Shepherd’s
Pipe” till he was quite out of breath,
Pollio said, “Fank you,” and pulled a lock
of front-hair without raising his head from
the pillow.</p>

<p>Nunky smiled to see, that, sick and cross
as he was, he did not forget his manners.</p>

<p>“Well, my little general, is there any
thing else I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“You may show me some o’ your pictures.”</p>

<p>Nunky brought two landscapes from his
studio. One was a brook half hidden by
bushes, and so natural that you could almost
see the leaves and grass flutter, and the
water slip bubbling over the stones.</p>

<p>“Rocky Brook!” cried Pollio, clapping
his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>He had “tagged” Dick to that brook
many a time when Dick went trouting.</p>

<p>“Wish I could dip my feet right in
there!” sighed he. “Oh, please give me a
drink o’ water!”</p>

<p>Somehow the picture made him thirsty.
The next one was of Yellowstone Falls,
which came tumbling down so fast you could
almost hear them rumble.</p>

<p>“Oh, splendid!” exclaimed Pollio. “Can’t
I have some cream beer?”</p>

<p>For the falls reminded him of something
foamy to drink. Nunky kindly brought him
some sarsaparilla-mead, wondering what
would be wanted next.</p>

<p>“More pictures, Nunky: I mean, <i>please!</i>”</p>

<p>Nunky brought another beautiful painting,
which he placed against the foot-board of the
bed.</p>

<p>“Oh! Jesus talking to the woman. Isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it splendid? Did he always look so sober,
Nunky?”</p>

<p>“No, I presume not.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t fink he did, ’cept when
little children were naughty, or Jerusalem
got out of order,” remarked Pollio, glancing
at an engraving on the wall called “Christ
weeping over Jerusalem.” Of course Jerusalem
must have “got out of order,” or he
would not have wept over it.</p>

<p>Pollio moved his head on the pillow uneasily.
He remembered that he, too, had “got
out of order;” and he did not like to look at
that beautiful, sad face at the foot of the
bed, for it seemed to know and feel sorry he
had been so naughty.</p>

<p>“Wish you’d take that picture away,
<i>please!</i>” said Pollio, twisting his mouth as
if in pain.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, General?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wish I’d runned away! Wish I <i>had</i>
runned away!” groaned the child, in such a
tone of anguish that Nunky began to fear
he was losing his reason.</p>

<p>“Wish you’d runned away? Why, I
should think you’d had trouble enough for
one day, without wishing for more.”</p>

<p>“Wish I’d runned away from the ‘Finny-castics’—<i>there!</i>
They kep’ a-comin’, and I
kep’ a-stayin’. That’s why I got stepped on,
’cause I kep’ a-stayin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t doubt you are right, General:
if you had not staid, you would not
have been stepped on. But how did you
happen to be in the street?”</p>

<p>“I was hunting for the disappearance of
my lost b’loon,” said Pollio, who still used
large words in the wrong place sometimes.</p>

<p>“Well, did you find the disappearance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But ’twas all busted up, sticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on the fence; and I lost it again. Oh,
dear! I ought to not gone, and I ought to
not staid, and I ought to not—where’s
mamma?”</p>

<p>“Asleep, I hope. What do you want of
her?”</p>

<p>“Well, I—I want to ask her, ‘Will she
forgive me?’”</p>

<p>“Do you? That’s a very good question
to ask. And here she comes,” said Nunky,
slipping out of the room; for he had waited
upon cross Pollio for four hours, and needed
rest.</p>

<p>Pollio confessed his naughtiness, and his
mother forgave him at once. Did you ever
hear of a mother that wouldn’t forgive her
darling child?</p>

<p>“O mamma! I sha’n’t ever do anyfing
bad any more,” said Pollio, laying his little
brown cheek against hers, so glad his sins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
were over for life. “I felt awful bad, and
that was why I wanted that water and that
cream beer; but it didn’t do me any good.
But now—O mamma!”</p>

<p>“What, dear?”</p>

<p>“If I only had some lemonade!”</p>

<p>“But I dare not give it to you, my child.
Won’t you try to be happy without it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” sighed Pollio. “I’ll be
happy if I can see my Posy. But, if I don’t
see her pretty soon, I’m afraid I’ll die!”</p>

<p>This touched his mother’s heart, and she
called Nunky to send for Posy. The little
girl entered the room with a look of the
deepest grief on her little face; but Pollio
said bravely, as Nunky lifted her up to kiss
him,—</p>

<p>“Poh, I’d twice as rather get hurt than
have <i>you</i>, Posy! I’m a <i>boy!</i>”</p>

<p>Posy’s only answer was to stroke his cheek
softly, and sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“That wolf stepped on me, that’s all.
Don’t cry, Posy! No, ’twas Billy Barstow—I
mean the colt.”</p>

<p>“Naughty fing! I don’t like Fourfs of
July!” said the gentle sister, not quite sure
whether to blame the colt, the wolf, or Billy.</p>

<p>“O Nunky! won’t you set her up on the
bed side o’ me?” said Pollio, who found her
remarks very consoling.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my b’loon Posy: where’s
yours?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t lost mine: a hole came
into it.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Teddy’s?”</p>

<p>“A hole camed into Teddy’s.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Nunky, “those three balloons
all spoiled in one day!”</p>

<p>“Whew! that’s mean!” said Pollio.
“But then,” added he, brightening, “now
you won’t feel so bad any more, Nunky, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
you <i>didn’t</i> have any b’loons when you were
a little boy; for <i>they don’t pay</i>.”</p>

<p>Nunky laughed, and called Pollio “a little
comforter.”</p>

<p>Pollio thought he might eat some supper,
if Posy would feed him: so mamma, wishing
to please the sick boy, tucked a napkin
under his chin, spread a table-cloth on the
bed, and gave him a silver waiter with dry
toast, plum-preserves, and sponge-cake.</p>

<p>Of course the children spilled milk, and
dropped crumbs; but they were as happy as
a pair of nestlings till Pollio suddenly swallowed
a plum-stone.</p>

<p>“O mamma! you pat him on the back
while I pray,” cried Posy, clasping her
hands. “Don’t you be afraid, Pollio. I
prayed when Teddy got choked, and <i>he</i>
didn’t die; and I’ll pray for you now, and
<i>you</i> won’t die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Pollio was soon relieved, but his little
sister would give him no more plums.</p>

<p>“Mamma, won’t you please stop making
plum-preserves?” said she anxiously. “It
keeps me praying all the time.”</p>

<p>Pollio thought he should be very wretched
if he could not see the fireworks; but, when
Posy declared she would not go without him,
he was consoled. And indeed, before it was
time for the rockets to go up, both the children
were fast asleep, their heads on the
same pillow, and their arms around each
other’s necks.</p>

<p>Thus ended Pollio’s Fourth of July; but
I am sorry to say it was not the end of his
illness.</p>

<p>Here is a rhyme that Nunky chanted over
to him just for fun:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>ON ALL-FOURS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Pollio</span> was better next day, and still
better the day after. By the time his father
came home he was feeling as well as ever,
and the sad affair was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>But, alas! a week after the accident Pollio
was seized with a very strange ailment.</p>

<p>It was morning. His bed-fellow, Teddy,
had dressed and gone down stairs, leaving
him playing with the yellow-tailed kitten;
but a little while after, when Posy went into
the chamber to say “Good-morning!” she
found her dear brother crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Posy! I can’t get up. When I try to
get up, I tumble down.”</p>

<p>She helped him with all the strength of
her little arms, but it did no good; for no
sooner was he fairly on his feet than he fell
again to the floor.</p>

<p>Very much frightened, she ran down
stairs, exclaiming,—</p>

<p>“My Pollio’s very sick: he can’t stand
up!”</p>

<p>“I think that must be a mistake, dear,”
said mamma, kissing her; “for I just heard
him and Teddy laughing together.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he was sick,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> know it,” returned Posy with
trembling lips. “He’s awful sick!”</p>

<p>When mamma saw that the little girl was
so much in earnest, she went up stairs with
her, though she did not suppose for a
moment that any thing really ailed Pollio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>When she saw him half dressed, and crying
helplessly, she put her arm round him,
and asked if his head ached.</p>

<p>“No’m: head doesn’t ache.”</p>

<p>“Is your throat sore?”</p>

<p>“No’m: froat isn’t sore.”</p>

<p>“Well, darling, where do you feel sick?”</p>

<p>“Not sick anywhere, mamma.”</p>

<p>“Are you crying because you and Teddy
have quarrelled?”</p>

<p>“No’m: we didn’t krorrel.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me, my little son, what is it?”</p>

<p>“<i>Can’t walk</i>, mamma,” sobbed the poor
child, plunging headlong upon the floor, and
crawling upon his hands and knees.</p>

<p>“Fie! that’s not nice. Get up, my son:
you’ll soil your clothes.”</p>

<p>“<i>Can’t</i> get up, mamma.”</p>

<p>“I <i>said</i> he couldn’t get up: my Pollio’s
very sick,” repeated Posy, hoping her mother
would believe her now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me see if there isn’t a pin or bit of
glass in his shoe,” said Mrs. Pitcher. But
when she had hunted, and found nothing,
she began to be alarmed, and sent Posy to
call her father. Posy went eagerly, for she
wanted papa to see and pity her Pollio.</p>

<p>Judge Pitcher was shocked to find his
little son creeping about like a baby, and
sent presently for Dr. Field.</p>

<p>When the doctor entered the room, Pollio
hid his face in his purple-bordered handkerchief,
with his forehead touching the
floor.</p>

<p>“Well, my little man, what’s this? Are
you playing baby? Oh, no! I guess you
are a black dog, like Beppo: let us hear you
bark.”</p>

<p>Pollio jerked both elbows angrily. He
did not like to be laughed at when he was in
trouble. But, if he had only known it, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
doctor pitied him very much, and was hiding
two big tears under his “eye-bushes.” For
he saw now that Pollio’s back had been hurt
worse than he supposed. There was a sore
spot on it; and, strange as it may seem, <i>that</i>
was why he could not walk.</p>

<p>“Well, how do you like being a dog?”
asked the doctor, scowling away another
tear.</p>

<p>“I’m not a dog,” exclaimed Pollio, turning
over on his side. “But my legs are
spoiled: they won’t go.”</p>

<p>“How do they feel?”</p>

<p>“They feel like India-rubber boots,”
snapped Pollio, thinking the doctor very
inquisitive.</p>

<p>“Well, I am going to give you some
medicine, and I hope in a few days they will
feel as stiff as <i>calfskin</i> boots,” said the doctor,
writing something on a slip of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>After he was gone, Judge Pitcher took
Pollio in his lap and tried to soothe him;
while the children clustered around, all talking
together.</p>

<p>“It seems queer,” said Teddy, “that his
legs won’t go, just because his back is hurt.
But I suppose the bones are all hitched together
somehow.”</p>

<p>“Wish the doctor’d unhitch ’em,” groaned
Pollio. “Oh, dear! I’m tired of being
hitched.”</p>

<p>“We hope this won’t last long, my son:
you will get over it by and by, and run as
fast as ever,” said his father. “Won’t you
try to be patient for a little while?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be patient!” cried Pollio,
swinging his arms. “I hate to awfully!”</p>

<p>Posy came then, and threw both her little
arms about his neck, as if to say, “I’ll help
you bear it, my Pollio.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma was going to help him too: you
could see that by the tender smile on her
face. Her heart ached for her darling boy,
but she would not let him know it: she
would always smile whenever she possibly
could.</p>

<p>The first day was pretty long. If you
don’t believe it, just shove yourself about on
the floor for half an hour, and see how it
seems.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Pollio, “I’d give ten
cents to buy some hinges for my legs.”</p>

<p>“Please, darling, don’t you s’pose if you’d
get on my back, I could carry you?” said
Posy.</p>

<p>It was the first time Pollio had smiled that
day; but it was such a funny speech from
that mite of a girl! He would as soon have
thought of leaning on a good-sized flower,
say a honeysuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, <i>Teddy</i> couldn’t hardly carry me:
<i>he</i> isn’t big enough,” said the poor boy, feeling
suddenly that he was very heavy.</p>

<p>“Well, papa can carry you, and Nunky
can carry you, and Dick.”</p>

<p>“Now, you stop! Do you s’pose I want to
go pickapack <i>all</i> the time?” whined unhappy
Pollio.</p>

<p>To comfort him, Posy took a glass of lemonade
from the table, and raised it to his lips,
and of course spilled it on his neck.</p>

<p>“Needn’t do that again, miss! Guess I
can drink my own self, ’thout <i>you</i> helping!”</p>

<p>Posy was deeply grieved, for this did not
sound like Pollio.</p>

<p>“No, I sha’n’t go pickapack, Posy Pitcher!
I shall go on my hands and knees long as <i>I</i>
live!”</p>

<p>Posy slid round to the arm of the sofa,
dropped her head, and began to cry softly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
It was hard to have him so cross; but she
could have borne that: it was the idea of his
never walking again that broke her heart.</p>

<p>“Where’s Beppo?—Beppo, come here!”
called Pollio.</p>

<p>The dog came wagging his tail, and,
seeing his master lying down and looking so
sad, trotted up to him, and licked his face
lovingly.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! I’m awful worse. I’m
going to be a doggie just like you. The
doctor says so. How do you like being a
dog?”</p>

<p>Beppo snuggled his head close to Pollio’s,
and licked his cheek again. The two heads
were of nearly the same color; but Beppo’s
hair was curly, and Pollio’s straight. Beppo’s
eyes were black, like his master’s, and
had just now a wistful look.</p>

<p>“He wants something: I guess he wants
to talk,” said Pollio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess so too,” said Posy, trying not to
sob.</p>

<p>Pollio lay for some time stroking the dog’s
nose. Did Beppo grieve about not talking
as boys did about not walking? That <i>would</i>
be sad indeed.</p>

<p>It was a long day and a very long week.
Pollio had friends enough. Oh, no lack of
those! Nunky, papa, and Dick carried him
pickapack; mamma and aunt Ann read to
him; Teddy was as kind as he could be; and,
as for Posy, there was nothing in the world
she wouldn’t have done for her Pollio. Then
the little boys in town—why, they rushed in
in an army! or you would have thought so
if you had heard Eliza scold about the mud
they brought on their shoes. Even Jimmy
Cushing came with a basket of fruit, and
begged forgiveness for hitting Pollio’s nose
ever so long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Hop-clover came, for Pollio wanted to see
her. “Poh! I s’pose you think you’re lame;
but look here,” said he, dropping on all-fours.
“Can you beat that?”</p>

<p>Hop-clover humbly confessed that she
couldn’t. <i>Her</i> lameness wasn’t much: a
horse never stepped on <i>her;</i> she only fell
down stairs when she was a baby, and she
<i>’spected</i> she lost out one o’ the bones. But
now she could read in the Second Reader,
and <i>she</i> didn’t care.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pitcher was so charmed with Hop-clover’s
sweet little face and patient ways,
that she gave her some of Edith’s dresses,
and asked her to come twice a week and stay
to tea. This made the little girl perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good your mamma is!” said she
to Posy. “It’s wicked to wish you was cats
and dogs, and I don’t; but I <i>’most</i> wish I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
your Muff or your Beppo, so I could live in
this house. I like a house that has a <i>sign</i> to
it,” added she, looking wistfully at the
framed motto over the nursery-door: “God
bless our home.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Pollio was as patient as Hop-clover,
and said he was “glad he had something
the rest of the family couldn’t catch.”
Sometimes, too, he thought he shouldn’t live
long. “When I die, I’ll ask God to let me
come down and see you <i>once</i>, Posy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll die first,” returned she.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I guess there’ll be a row if <i>I</i>
can’t go up and see <i>you</i>,” said Pollio.</p>

<p>He really meant no harm; but he did say
very improper things sometimes, and it
troubled Posy.</p>

<p>When Nunky told him a story, he begged
that it might be about Indians, for he liked
to feel his hair stand on end. Posy could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
not understand that at all: there were many
things about her dear brother she never
<i>would</i> understand.</p>

<p>But Nunky refused to tell horrible stories,
and chose only such as the children would
be the better and happier for remembering.
He was very kind, too, about drawing pictures
on the slate for Pollio to copy; and
this was a thing the little fellow greatly
enjoyed.</p>

<p>Indeed, everybody was so kind to him,
that the small boys in town rather envied
Pollio. “I’d ’most be willing to creep round
as he does, if my mamma’d give me such nice
things to eat,” said they; which shows that
they had no idea of Pollio’s trials.</p>

<p>When he was down stairs, he wanted to go
up; and, when he was up stairs, he wanted
to come down. You would feel just as he
did if you couldn’t walk. Everybody was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ready to carry him, and nobody complained,
But Pollio found after a while that he did
not need so many “horses:” he could travel
on all-fours nearly as fast as Beppo or Muff.</p>

<p>You ought to have seen him run! How
he did run away from his medicine! Why,
he went so fast that his aunt Ann could not
catch him. It was her business to give him
his drops three times a day; but the moment
she began to shake the vial he was missing.
He could slip out of the room without any
noise, then up stairs or down cellar,—anywhere
to get away from that hateful vial and
spoon.</p>

<p>“Pollio, this is very naughty,” said his
auntie, quite out of breath. “Your little
sister Alice didn’t behave like this: she took
<i>her</i> medicine without any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Did she? Then what made her die?”
exclaimed Pollio, slipping under a chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>It was too hard for aunt Ann to be led
such a chase; and Nunky said he would take
charge of the medicine. Pollio knew then
that it was all over with him, for Nunky
could run like a fox. But Nunky had no
idea of running. He was a man who believed
that little children should be taught
to obey.</p>

<p>“Pollio, you have made enough trouble,
my boy; and from this time I expect you to
swallow your medicine as soon as I have
counted ‘One, two, three.’”</p>

<p>Pollio looked up, and saw his uncle was in
earnest.</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t you catch me first?”</p>

<p>“Catch you? No, sir! you’re already
caught! Open your mouth, General, ‘One,
two, <i>three!</i>’”</p>

<p>Pollio swallowed, and sighed; and after that
there was no more trouble about the drops.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>BEPPO TALKING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Littlefield</span> came to see Pollio while
he was lame, and brought some fine honey
which his wife “Liddy” had sent.</p>

<div class='ref'>
<a href="#Page_99">Page 99.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“It is hard for thee to learn the lesson of
patience so young; but it will do thee good,
my boy,” said he, patting Pollio’s head with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Is Dr. Field any <i>’lation</i> to you, Mr. <i>Little</i>field?”
asked Pollio anxiously; and was
very glad to learn he was not. Pollio loved
Mr. Littlefield dearly; but he would never
love the doctor on account of his dreadful
jokes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>While Mr. Littlefield was at the house,
something happened to Beppo which I must
tell you about.</p>

<p>Now, Beppo was not only a pleasant playfellow
for the children, he was also a dog of
very fine character. But he had one fault:
he would bark in the night whenever the
least noise roused him, and bark so furiously,
too, that he waked everybody in the house.
For this reason it was thought best that he
should sleep in the stable; but even there he
sometimes made such a noise as to disturb
the family.</p>

<p>The children had often heard their father
say he meant to punish Beppo for this; but
they did not believe he would ever do it, for
he was as gentle-hearted as a woman, and
extremely fond of the good dog.</p>

<p>But, on the very night when the Quaker
was visiting them, the judge and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
were wakened by the terrific barking of
Beppo. It kept on and on, louder and
louder, till the judge grew very nervous.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t I whipped that dog long
ago?” said he.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to have done it,” replied
his wife. “He is a dear old fellow, but
it is our duty to cure him of his faults.”</p>

<p>“I declare I’ve a great mind to go out to
the stable this minute,” said the judge.</p>

<p>“Well, if you do go, you won’t whip him,
my dear: so I advise you to take brother
Rufus with you.”</p>

<p>“Rufus, indeed! Why, I’m not quite a
baby,” said the judge, springing out of bed:
“if I make up my mind to whip that dog,
I can do it.”</p>

<p>I dare say if Mrs. Pitcher had not spoken
of calling uncle Rufus, her husband would
not have gone, and then Beppo would not
have been punished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>I must confess he did not hurt the dog
one bit. Beppo did not feel the horse-whip
any more than if it had been a wisp of
straw; but he hung his head in grief, for
it was the first blow he had ever received.
When all was over, he gave a side-glance
at his master, as if to say, “I’ll never do so
again: I won’t bark any more.” And then
he lay down very meekly on a cushion of
hay; and the judge went back to bed, thinking
he had done his duty, but feeling sorry
enough to cry.</p>

<p>There was no more noise that night from
Beppo; though two or three carriages passed,
and he must have heard them, and wanted
to bark.</p>

<p>Next morning he lingered about the yard,
ashamed to come into the house.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, he takes it to heart!” said
the judge; and then told what happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The children looked sober; and Posy
gazed through her tears at Pollio, who
winked hard, and tried to brave it out.
Friend Littlefield was glad to see that they
all cared so much for the dog.</p>

<p>But, just as the breakfast-bell rang, Teddy
rushed into the parlor, exclaiming,—</p>

<p>“Papa, our pears are stolen!”</p>

<p>“Pears, child! What pears?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know those two trees bending
down to the ground,—the nicest pears there
are in the world. Well, there isn’t a thing
left but just the leaves!”</p>

<p>“And that must have been what Beppo
was barking for. No doubt he heard the
thieves at work, and was trying to let us
know it. The faithful old creature!” said
the judge, looking distressed, but thinking
much more about the dog than about the
pears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“O papa! And you w’ipped him!” cried
Pollio, whirling round and round on the
floor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed papa, “I whipped him.”</p>

<p>Pollio didn’t try any longer to brave it
out: he swept through the room like a
hurricane, to go and have a cry on his dear
dog’s neck.</p>

<p>“How’d I feel if my papa had w’ipped
<i>me</i> when I wasn’t naughty!” said he. But
he couldn’t possibly imagine it; for he had
never been punished even by a “love-pat”
in his whole little life.</p>

<p>Beppo was hugged half to death by the
children; and the judge himself stroked his
head, called him “fine fellow,” and fed him
from his own hand with broiled beef-steak.</p>

<p>“Does he know you’re sorry, papa?”
asked Pollio.</p>

<p>“Well, I think he has some notion of it:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
at any rate, he knows we’re good friends
once more. See, he wags his tail, and looks
quite cheerful again.”</p>

<p>“So he does,” laughed Posy, clapping her
hands. “Real cheerful! I guess he’ll get
over it, don’t you? He won’t think you
are a bad man now.”</p>

<p>Posy could not bear to have him think
her father a bad man; and it was plain that
he did not, for he licked the judge’s hand
after finishing the steak, and looked up in
his face as if he trusted him with his whole
heart.</p>

<p>“Dogs know ’most as much as folks,” said
Posy. “I’ll make a chain of flowers, and
we’ll put it on his neck, and I guess he’ll
like it; don’t you?”</p>

<p>Pollio was sure he would be charmed.
And, whether Beppo enjoyed the flowers or
not, he must have known he was treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
uncommonly well that day; for he had a
dish of cream for dessert, and was allowed
to spend most of his time in the parlor.</p>

<p>Now, what follows is not a dream or a
fairy-story, though I know it will sound very
strange. It really happened that morning,
while the twins and uncle Rufus were in the
parlor, and Beppo was lying on the rug,
watching Pollio.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about
Beppo, except that he was a large, handsome
dog. His eyes just now had an asking look,
as if he longed to say something: but you
have seen that sort of look in any dog’s
eyes; it isn’t at all uncommon.</p>

<p>“Beppo wants to speak, I know he does,”
said Pollio to Posy.</p>

<p>The dog wagged his tail, as if to reply,
“You understand my feelings, my dear little
master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, try it: see if you can’t speak.”
Beppo raised his eyes, wagged his tail again,
and, to the intense surprise of the children,
said, or seemed to say, in a fine, piping
voice,—</p>

<p>“<i>I was w’ipped last night.</i>”</p>

<p>Pollio rolled over; and Posy sprang up,
exclaiming,—</p>

<p>“Who said that?”</p>

<p>“Why, who did?” cried Pollio, almost
turning a somerset.</p>

<p>There was no person in the room but
themselves and Nunky, who was too busy
reading the newspaper to take any notice.
Who had spoken? It <i>couldn’t</i> be Beppo!</p>

<p>“<i>Your papa w’ipped me!</i>” said the piping
voice again, Beppo still gazing straight at
Pollio.</p>

<p>How wonderful! It was exactly the sort
of voice a dog would be likely to speak with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
if he could speak at all: it was thin and
babyish.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” cried Posy.</p>

<p>“My sakes!” cried Pollio.</p>

<p>They knew as well as you do that dogs
are dumb animals; but here was Beppo
looking right up in their faces, and talking.
They were greatly excited.</p>

<p>“Uncle Rufus, uncle Ru-<i>fus!</i>”</p>

<p>But they had to run up to him, and pull
his sleeve, before he would pay any attention.</p>

<p>“Uncle Ru-<i>fus!</i> Beppo is talking!”</p>

<p>“Oh! is he? Well, why shouldn’t he talk?
He has lived so long among chatter-boxes
that I should think he might by this time.”</p>

<p>“But you needn’t make fun, Nunky. He
did talk just now. I’ll leave it to Posy.”</p>

<p>“<i>That’s so!</i>” replied Beppo, wagging his
tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, hear him!” exclaimed Posy, dancing
about in a great flutter; while Pollio rolled
over and over, and jerked his elbows, crying,—</p>

<p>“I never, never, never! Did <i>you</i> ever,
uncle Rufus?”</p>

<p>“<i>Your papa w’ipped me!</i>” repeated Beppo.</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus seemed very much interested
now, and watched the dog closely; but he
was a man who was seldom surprised at any
thing.</p>

<p>“No, I never heard a dog talk before; but
what is there so very remarkable about it?
Parrots can talk; and parrots don’t know
half as much as dogs.”</p>

<p>“O Nunky, Nunky! it <i>is</i> queer,” exclaimed
Pollio, astonished at his uncle’s
coolness. “Why, he has lived here ever
so long, and didn’t ever talk before.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Posy; “no more’n the cat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did he happen to speak now?”</p>

<p>“Why, I asked him to.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you did, did you?”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think it’s queer, Nunky?
don’t you think it’s queer?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather so, perhaps; but I always
knew Beppo was a bright dog.—Come here,
old fellow, and tell us why you never talked
before.”</p>

<p>“<i>Afraid you’d laugh at me</i>,” replied Beppo,
looking up in Mr. Gilman’s face rather bashfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must tell mamma! I must tell
everybody!” burst forth the twins with
one voice.</p>

<p>Mamma was busy up stairs with her dressmaker;
and nobody was to be found but
Teddy, who smiled in the most provoking
way when told that Beppo was talking.</p>

<p>“You expect me to believe that story, do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
you?” said he, entering the parlor with a
curling lip.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> see!” cried Pollio. “There, Beppo,
sir, this is Teddy. Now say, ‘How do you
do, Teddy?’”</p>

<p>Beppo held out his paw as he had been
taught to do, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“<i>That’s</i> the way he talks, is it?” said
Teddy scornfully. “I’ve seen him do as
much as that a good many times.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but he <i>did</i> talk, now truly.—We
didn’t cheat; did we, Posy?—Talk again,
Beppo. Say, ‘Your papa w’ipped me,’ and
I’ll give you some cream.”</p>

<p>Beppo rolled his soft brown eyes as if
trying to speak, but not a sound passed his
lips.</p>

<p>“Say one word; say ‘Teddy,’ and I’ll
give you some chicken.”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, say some other word. I don’t care
what word.”</p>

<p>Still Beppo was speechless.</p>

<p>“Poh! I can’t stop any longer for this: it’s
too foolish,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh! just a minute, Teddy. He did talk
before you came in. I’ll leave it to Nunky.—Didn’t
Beppo talk?”</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus dropped his newspaper upon
his knee with a roguish smile.</p>

<p>“Teddy, will you believe me if I say he
did?”</p>

<p>“No, sir: I <i>can’t</i> believe you,” said Teddy
stoutly, “because there’s no common sense
in saying a dog talks.”</p>

<p>“Then I sha’n’t say it.”</p>

<p>“O Nunky, that’s too, <i>too</i> bad!” cried
Posy.</p>

<p>“Up and down mean!” cried Pollio; “for
you <i>heard</i> him talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I, my child? Why, I never heard a dog
talk in my life!”</p>

<p>“O Nunky, Nunky Gilman! When you
were the very one that sat right there and
looked straight at Beppo, and heard him say,
‘Your papa w’ipped me.’”</p>

<p>“I heard him say nothing of the kind,”
returned uncle Rufus, rising, and planting
himself on the rug, with his arms folded.</p>

<p>“There, there! I knew better all the
time,” said Teddy, snapping his fingers.</p>

<p>This <i>was</i> very trying.</p>

<p>“O Nunky, Nunky!” cried angry Pollio,
“you’ve told a”—</p>

<p>“You’ve made a little mistake,” struck in
Posy, as angry as her brother, but more
polite.</p>

<p>“They say ‘little Pitchers have great
ears,’” said uncle Rufus, smiling: “perhaps
they hear what isn’t to be heard. Think a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
minute, children, and see if you can’t be
wrong. If a dog <i>should</i> talk, it would be
a miracle.”</p>

<p>“But we heard him,” said Pollio.</p>

<p>“Did you see his lips move?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I—I don’ know. I didn’t think of
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to teach you to think, my
boy; and that is why I have teased you a
little. Beppo will speak again; and perhaps
you’ll watch his lips this time, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“<i>Your papa w’ipped me</i>,” squeaked the
fine little voice; but the twins both observed
that Beppo never opened his mouth. They
saw now that their uncle had been playing
a trick upon them.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I know, now I know! Nunky
did it himself.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did, you goosie! ’Fore
I’d be so silly as you and Posy,” said
Teddy, proud of his own wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so fast, Teddy,” said his uncle.
“I could have cheated you in the same
way a year or two ago. And I don’t believe
now you can tell how I do it. Look
at me while I speak so again.”</p>

<p>Teddy did look; but uncle Rufus scarcely
stirred his lips, as he said in a voice that
seemed to come from the very depths of
the cellar,—</p>

<p>“<i>I’m a rat! I’m drowning in the pork-barrel!</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh! how <i>do</i> you do it?” cried Teddy.
“How can you make your voice sound <i>way
off</i>, and so different from <i>your</i> voice? Do
you do it down in your stomach?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. It is called ‘ventriloquism.’
I have cheated wiser people than
our little Pitchers in this way.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t cheat <i>me</i> again,” said
little Pollio, deeply mortified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“No: because next time you will <i>think</i>.
But here comes friend Littlefield. Now,
Teddy, don’t you tell him about this; please
don’t.”</p>

<p>It was well Nunky said that; for Teddy
was rather apt to report “the children’s”
little mistakes, and they were very sensitive
about it.</p>

<p>Pollio had now been lame for several
weeks, and everybody thought it might be
months before he would get well. But, one
morning not long after this, Posy swung
open the dining-room door, drawing her
brother after her, and saying gleefully,—</p>

<p>“O mamma! O papa! my Pollio can
walk!”</p>

<p>Yes, he was actually walking. Never was
Napoleon Bonaparte any prouder after a
great victory than our little hero as he
stalked into that dining-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>They all rose from the table just as surprised
as they had been on the first morning
when he <i>couldn’t</i> walk. Then what a clapping
of hands, what a shouting! Eliza
Potter and Jane Roarty, who were in the
kitchen, wondered what could have happened;
and so did Ike, who was passing by
the dining-room windows.</p>

<p>Ike saw Mrs. Pitcher hugging Pollio as if
he were the best boy in the world, just
because his legs had stopped feeling like
India-rubber boots; and then they hugged
him all round, and his father tossed him up
to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Let’s celebrate; let’s have a picnic at
Rocky Brook,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“But Pollio can’t walk so far,” objected
Edith.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I can. I can walk all over the
world,” exclaimed Pollio, trying to dance,
but tipping backward against Teddy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE LAKE OF LILIES.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Six’m.</span>”</p>

<p>Teddy laughed, for that was what Posy
said one day when a lady asked how old she
was.</p>

<p>A whole year had passed since the twins
began to go to school, and nearly a year
since Pollio was hurt. People had almost
forgotten the time when he crept on all-fours;
for he was as active as ever now,
indeed, the “spryest” boy in town.</p>

<p>But his lameness had done him a little
good. He was more careful to obey his
mother, and he was more thoughtful of sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
people. He did not whoop quite so loud
now when aunt Ann had the headache; and
he was very kind indeed to Hop-clover, who
never, never, would be able to walk without
limping.</p>

<p>Hop-clover’s mother, who <i>wasn’t</i> her
mother, had run away; and sometimes the
man she called father didn’t come home all
night, and poor Hop-clover had to go to the
neighbors’ houses to sleep: but she was a
happy child, for all that, and still said to
Posy, with a smile, “God will take care o’
<i>me!</i>” Her own mother had told her so,
and she always believed it.</p>

<p>“Pollio, my son,” said Judge Pitcher one
morning. Pollio came hobbling along, with
a mallet under his arm for a make-believe
crutch. He and Posy were playing croquet.</p>

<p>“Will you run to the ‘little woman’s’
store for me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The children called Miss Rounds “the
little woman,” because she was small, and
had a hump on her back.</p>

<p>“Come, Posy,” said Pollio, rushing for his
hat.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit, my son. What are you
going for?”</p>

<p>Pollio looked a little ashamed; but he
always <i>was</i> in such a hurry! He and Posy
came back for the errand, and saw that their
father was holding out his beautiful cream-colored
meerschaum, with a lady’s head
carved on the bowl. He wanted some tobacco.</p>

<p>“O papa!” said Posy, looking grieved.</p>

<p>“Well, darling, you needn’t go with brother
unless you choose. But why don’t you
want papa to smoke?”</p>

<p>Posy blushed, but could not answer.</p>

<p>“Come here, my love, and whisper it in
my ear,” said her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“So his mouth’ll be sweet to kiss, like
Nunky’s,” whispered the little girl, with
another blush.</p>

<p>“Dear papa! I wish you’d cure him of
smoking. Will you try?” whispered mamma.</p>

<p>Posy looked up to see if she were in
earnest.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, I’ll try,” said she gravely,
and ran to join Pollio.</p>

<p>“What were you whispering about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll see!” replied Posy, with an
air of importance. “Let <i>me</i> buy the tobacco.”</p>

<p>When they reached “the little woman’s”
store, Posy walked up to the counter ahead
of Pollio, and said with much decision, “If
you please’m, we want the worst tobacco
you’ve got.”</p>

<p>Miss Rounds stared.</p>

<p>“The <i>worst!</i>” exclaimed she, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
along the row of glass boxes, and then
back again at solemn Miss Posy. “Did
your papa say so?”</p>

<p>“No’m; but we want to cure him of
smoking.”</p>

<p>The little woman laughed, and the next
time she saw the judge she told him about
it.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said he thoughtfully, “if
my little daughter is taking me in hand, it
is high time I tried to do better.”</p>

<p>He knew Posy did not like his pipe, and
he began to think that was why Nunky got
more of her kisses than he did. Dainty
little Posy! The touch of her sweet, pure
lips was very precious to her father.</p>

<p>He tried her that night. He did not take
out his meerschaum; and she remained sitting
on his knee, looking very happy, instead
of slipping off, and running to Nunky. She
kissed him, too, a great many times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do love papa; don’t you, darling?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dearly I do! But I wish your head
wasn’t so bald,” said Posy, patting it mournfully.
“I’m afraid you’ll be my grandpa
’fore I know it.”</p>

<p>The judge laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, poor papa can’t help growing bald.
But do you think he’s nicer when he doesn’t
smoke?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ever and <i>ever</i> so nicer!”</p>

<p>“And how many sweet kisses will you
give me every day I’m good and don’t
smoke?”</p>

<p>“Five hundred million thousand!” cried
Posy, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>Papa smiled, and said that was one too
many; and then he looked sober, for he had
a great mind to begin, for Posy’s sake, to
stop smoking. Dr. Field said the pipe was
making him sick, and had often scolded; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Posy’s kisses touched him much more than
the scoldings.</p>

<p>From this time he really broke off the
habit entirely; and it was his little daughter
who cured him.</p>

<p>One day Posy was crying on the street, as
she was walking with Pollio; and, before she
could wipe her eyes, Dr. Field crossed over,
and asked,—</p>

<p>“Ah, what’s the matter, Mrs. Thumb?”</p>

<p>“She’s crying about your whiskers,” spoke
up Pollio, who needn’t have told. “I said I
was going to have some just like ’em when
I grow up, and then she cried.”</p>

<p>Dr. Field laughed, and said,—</p>

<p>“Well, well, Mrs. Thumb, I suppose he
will; but don’t cry about ’em till they begin
to grow.”</p>

<p>If he hadn’t called her Mrs. Thumb! and
if he hadn’t laughed! Dr. Field was a wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
man in every thing else, but he didn’t
understand little folks.</p>

<p>He had really crossed the street to say
something delightful, for a wonder. The
sabbath school was to have a picnic next
day, and he wanted to be the one to tell the
good news; but, in laughing at Posy, he had
forgotten it.</p>

<p>The children went home. Pollio led Posy
into the parlor, and was affectionately drying
her eyes with the lace curtain, when Mr.
Lane, the new minister, called. Eliza went
for Mrs. Pitcher; and Posy was going too,
but her brother held her back. He thought
they both ought to stay and entertain the
stranger till mamma came down.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dears,” said Mr. Lane,
with a smile very different from Dr. Field’s:
“I suppose this is Judge Pitcher’s little
daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Posy, blushing.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” cried Pollio, stepping up, and
offering his little hand. He was tired of
being told that he did not look like the rest
of the family, and meant to explain matters
at once. “Folks think I’m French or Latin,
but I’m not. I’m my father’s youngest son.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m very glad to hear it. Pardon
me for not knowing you at once,” laughed
the minister. “So you are this dear little
girl’s brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Pollio, much pleased to
hear her called “a dear little girl.” “Oh, I
tell you, she’s a jolly good sister! Sometimes
I think she’s better than <span class="smcap">ME</span>!”</p>

<p>The minister laughed again, but very
pleasantly. He had a fair, sunny face, and
kind manner; and children always opened
their little hearts to him at once. He took
Posy on his knee, and she sat there quietly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
blushing, it is true, but more for Pollio’s
speeches than for fear of Mr. Lane. It <i>was</i>
strange what things that boy would say
sometimes. Posy being so very silent, he
thought <i>he</i> ought to keep up the conversation:
so he leaned his elbow on the
minister’s other knee, and asked the first
question that came into his little head:—</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" width="361" height="600" alt="Pollio drying Posy's eyes" />
<div class="caption">“Pollio led Posy into the Parlor, and was affectionately
drying her Eyes with the Lace Curtain.”</div>

<div class='ref'>
<a href="#Page_120">Page 120.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“How many p’licemen s’pose you could
lick?” For he thought Mr. Lane looked
pretty strong. Posy blushed; and so did
Mrs. Pitcher, who was just entering the
room.</p>

<p>But Mr. Lane only smiled. He knew a
good deal about children; for he had three
little boys of his own, and <i>they</i> did not
always talk properly.</p>

<p>He could not stay very long. He had
called to invite all the family to a sail to-morrow
on the Lake of Lilies. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sabbath school was to go in the cars to a
steamboat, and spend the day on the water.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Pollio shouted. The
Lake of Lilies!—he knew no more about it
than he did about the hanging-gardens of
Babylon; but that was all the better,
“Hurrah! Going to the Lake of Lilies!”</p>

<p>He was <i>so</i> happy that his mother was
obliged to send him out of the room. Of
course she couldn’t let him turn somersets
before an entire stranger. Posy was just as
happy as he was, but she didn’t make so
much noise about it.</p>

<p>“What dear little creatures!” thought
Mr. Lane, as they both left the room. “The
boy is slightly rough, but his love for his
sister atones for every thing.”</p>

<p>Pollio hadn’t known so long a day since
his lameness. Have you ever observed how
long the day always seems when something
pleasant is going to happen to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think a picnic is perfectly splendid!
I’ve forgot what you pick, though,” said
Posy, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>“You pick people’s cupboards, <i>I</i> should
say,” replied Eliza, measuring out sugar. “I
hate the very sound of a picnic! I thought
I had all I could do before, but now here’s
queen-cake”—</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right, ’Liza! And some
strawb’ry-jelly tarts, and cherry-turnovers,
and peach-pie!” cried Pollio, turning a
somerset in the middle of the floor. Eliza
winked her eyelashes, and said something
about children’s being seen, and not heard.
Pollio thought they had a right to be heard,
and so do I at proper times; but I must say
these little Pitchers did trouble Jane and
Eliza too much. Jane was a saint, and
could sweep a floor with children under her
broom; but Eliza couldn’t make cake unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the kitchen was clear, and said so much
about “going crazy,” and “wanting to fly,”
that Pollio really thought she wasn’t quite
right in her mind.</p>

<p>“No: not strawb’ry-jelly tarts, but plum-jelly
tarts, and ice-cream, and—oh, dear,
Posy! <i>you</i> say what else.—I want a basketful,
’Liza, and Posy wants a basketful, and
Teddy wants a basketful, and Edy wants”—</p>

<p>Before Pollio could finish, he was on the
other side of the kitchen-door, and the door
was shut in his face.</p>

<p>Eliza was ashamed of her temper next
minute, and sent Posy after him with a hot
cream-cake.</p>

<p>“Won’t Eliza make a queer angel, though,
when she dies?” said Pollio, as he broke the
cake in two pieces, to divide with Posy.
“If she acts like this, they won’t have her in
the parlor with the rest of the angels, <i>you’d</i>
better believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>But he always forgave Eliza very sweetly;
and her putting him out of the kitchen
never made any difference about his going
right back again to be as troublesome as
ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>POSY’S ROSEBUD.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Eliza</span> was cross all day; but, as Dick
said, the crosser she was, the better she
cooked. At any rate, there was food enough
next morning, and of the most delicious sort,
to fill three large baskets; and only seven
people were going.</p>

<p>There were tarts and turnovers, and crumpets
and cake, and Washington-pie, not to
mention cold corned beef and boiled ham.</p>

<p>“All that for seven mouths? Why, it
will feed half the party!” exclaimed Nunky,
as he helped Nanty pack it into the baskets.</p>

<p>“Wait till we come home, and see if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bring any thing back,” said she, finding
room for two dozen boiled eggs in the corners,
with a little paper bag of pepper and
salt.</p>

<p>“What we don’t eat ourselves, we shall
give to little Hop-clover and the other stray
birds. Oh! there’s no danger of taking too
much,” added Nanty, fastening down the
covers.</p>

<p>She and Nunky were going, and were to
take care of the children, while Judge
Pitcher and his wife staid at home. “How
dreary it would be in that great lonesome
house all day, with no noise but the ticking
of the clocks!” thought the little Pitchers,
and wondered their parents could look so
cheerful. For them this trip to the Lake of
Lilies was the great event of the summer,
and everybody who could not go was very
much to be pitied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>When Posy was dressed all in white for
the ride, she looked so beautiful, that the
whole family had to kiss and keep kissing
her, till Pollio was out of all patience; for
he was in a hurry to get to the cars. He
had been up ever since sunrise, and had filled
every one of his pockets with peanuts to eat
on the way in case of “hungriness.” Nanty
had sternly declared the picnic-baskets should
not be opened till dinner-time; and he did
have a perfect horror of “hungriness.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe, after all, I’ll go with
you as far as the steamboat, if your mother
doesn’t mind,” said Judge Pitcher, snatching
up his hat at the last minute.</p>

<p>The cars were full. All the children in
town seemed to be going; and, by the smiles
on their faces, you would think they were all
in love with the Lake of Lilies, and would
rather see it than any other spot in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge Pitcher took Posy on his knee;
and a gentleman in the next seat touched
him on the shoulder, and said,—</p>

<p>“Well, you must be a proud father to
have such a lovely little girl as that!”</p>

<p>He was a perfect stranger; but he looked
at Posy with a smile, of course, and offered
her a rosebud. She blushed, and thanked
him, and was going to give it to papa to
keep for her; but papa pinned it into the
bosom of her frock. He <i>was</i> proud: he did
think his little girl and the pink rosebud
looked very much alike,—both so sweet, so
pure, so beautiful!</p>

<p>When they reached the steamboat, “The
Lady of the Lake,” he went on board with
the party, and said to the twins,—</p>

<p>“Now I leave you in charge of uncle
Rufus and aunt Ann.”</p>

<p>“Just’s if <i>I</i> couldn’t take care o’ my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
little sister <i>myself!</i>” cried Pollio, quite
offended.</p>

<p>“Well, see that you do it,” said papa,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please take care of me too?”
asked Miss Croswell, their sabbath-school
teacher.</p>

<p>Pollio saw at once that she was making
sport of him: so he did not answer, but
drew himself up like a little man, and threw
one arm protectingly around his sister.</p>

<p>Then papa kissed all the children, and the
twins twice over, saying to Posy,—</p>

<p>“Good-by, my own little rosebud.”</p>

<p>And, when he walked up the wharf, he
carried a picture in his mind of a beautiful
little girl with a pink rosebud on her bosom.</p>

<p>There was such a crowd on the boat, that
uncle Rufus and aunt Ann watched the little
ones every moment; while Edith took care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of Teddy. None of the children knew they
were watched, however: they thought they
were all helping Dick look out for the baskets.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a merrier party?” said
Nanty to Nunky, as she held Posy’s hand,
and looked round upon the bright little
faces.</p>

<p>Hop-clover was there in a faded but
clean calico frock, hugging a paper bag of
crackers, which was all she could find for
her dinner; but, if it had been roast turkey
and plum-pudding, she could not have
looked gayer.</p>

<p>“Nunky, please let go my hand,” said
Pollio. “I want to show Posy how the
paddles work.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’ll let you both pitch
overboard?” said Nunky, grasping the little
general’s hand the closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But he led him along to the side of the
boat, while Nanty and the rest followed.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> you may show Posy how the paddles
work,” said he. “Dick, perch her up
on the railing, while I attend to Pollio.”</p>

<p>Pollio looked rather sulky. It was strange
that people thought he ought to be “attended
to,” when he felt quite able to take care
of the whole party.</p>

<p>“The Lady of the Lake” was a fast-sailing
steamer, and moved with proud grace, as if
alive, and pleased to hear the children praising
her.</p>

<p>“See what waves of light we leave behind
us!” said Nunky, pointing to the stern of
the boat, where the pale-green water was
churned into foam.</p>

<p>“Oh, how <i>beau</i>tiful! It looks like roses
and diamonds and gold rings, and—and
<i>every thing!</i>” cried Posy, watching the many-colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bubbles that shone in the sun as if a
million jewels were broken up, and dancing
in the water.</p>

<p>The boat landed at last at the town of
Gray; and the party of children formed a
line, and marched to Aspen Grove, where
dinner was to be served. It had been very
bright all the morning: but, by the time they
reached the grove, the sun wrapped himself
in a cloud, like an invalid in a great-coat;
and it seemed so much like rain, that the
teachers thought best to dine in the Town
Hall.</p>

<p>What a blow to the children! They had
seen the grove, and it was beautiful. There
were swings dangling from the trees; there
were croquet-sets lying about in boxes ready
to be put up; but the most welcome sight of
all was the row of long wooden tables where
the food was to have been placed. Must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
they leave all this, and be shut up in the
house?</p>

<p>“Humph! T’won’t rain, you see’f it
does! my papa didn’t say nuffin’ ’bout it,”
sniffed Pollio, as they turned, and formed a
line again to march to the hall.</p>

<p>They had no sooner entered than it began
to pour. There were no tables in the hall;
and the teachers said each family might eat
in a seat by itself, and call it a “basket
picnic.”</p>

<p>Nobody liked this; but perhaps there was
not a child present so disappointed as little
Hop-clover. She did not suppose any one
knew what she carried in her paper bag; and
she had meant to set the bag on the table
beside the baskets, where it would not be
noticed. But now she must eat with several
other children, beside Miss Ware her teacher,
who was a fine lady in a beautiful silk dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and lace shawl. She had eaten very little
breakfast, but she would almost rather
starve than open that paper bag.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you eat, Cindy?” asked the
little girl at her left, with a bit of nice cake
in her mouth.</p>

<p>“I guess my head aches some,” replied
Hop-clover; and it did really ache, and her
heart too.</p>

<p>Aunt Ann, who was three seats behind
Hop-clover, happened to look up just as she
was passing the boiled eggs, and saw that
hungry, friendless look on the poor lame
girl’s face.</p>

<p>“Why, how I’ve been neglecting that
child!” said she. “Make room for her, Dick
and Edy, and I’ll go bring her into our seat.”</p>

<p>So she went and brought her, and Hop-clover’s
headache went off in a twinkling;
though I fancy it wasn’t Nanty’s gold smelling-bottle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that cured it, so much as the
cream-biscuits, cold meat, and crumpets.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish she was my auntie!” thought
little Hop-clover, gazing at pretty Miss Ann
wistfully.</p>

<p>Posy, thinking she looked sober about
something, crept closer to her, and laid her
cheek against her hand.</p>

<p>“Isn’t every thing so nice?” said she.
It was all she could think of to say; but she
wanted Hop-clover to know she liked her in
their seat, eating with them.</p>

<p>Before dinner was over, the sun had
thrown off his great-coat of clouds; and the
children were soon rushing out of the house,
gayer than ever. There were running and
laughing, and playing and singing. It was
a day of almost perfect delight; and, when
“The Lady of the Lake” whistled to call
them back, nobody was ready to go except
the grown people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall be thankful if we once get these
children home,” remarked Nanty aside to
Nunky, after they were all on board. “I’m
so afraid somebody will fall into the water!”</p>

<p>Alas! there was a far greater danger;
though nobody thought of it, not even the
man who was putting coal under the boiler.
This man was proud of “The Lady of the
Lake,” and wanted her to skim over the
water as fast as possible: so perhaps he made
too much fire; and perhaps, too, there was
a crack in the red-hot iron. I don’t quite
know what <i>was</i> the trouble; but something
terrible happened,—the boiler blew up.</p>

<p>I shall not describe the scene on the boat;
for, even if I knew how to do it, it is too
dreadful to write or even think about.</p>

<p>That night there were terror and distress
throughout the whole town of Rosewood.
Everybody knew that “The Lady of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Lake” had met with an awful accident, and
that some of the children who had gone on
the excursion would not come home alive,
while many others were fearfully hurt.</p>

<p>Judge Pitcher and his wife did not know
of it for some hours. While out riding, they
were stopped on the street by “the little
woman,” who exclaimed with a white face,—</p>

<p>“A despatch from Muldoon! ‘The Lady
of the Lake’ blown to pieces!”</p>

<p>The judge did not wait for another word,
but drove furiously to the telegraph-office.
There he learned that the cars were to arrive
half an hour later than usual, bringing the
dead and wounded.</p>

<p>“Let us hurry home. Let us be ready,”
whispered Mrs. Pitcher.</p>

<p>There was not the least color in her face,
but her husband knew she would not faint.
A mother has no time to faint when she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
waiting to hear whether her children are
alive or dead.</p>

<p>I don’t know why; but the judge was
thinking of Posy, and fancying, if any of his
children were lost, it would be this darling
of the family.</p>

<p>He was right. All the rest were safe;
but dear little Posy was brought home on
cushions, her sweet eyes closed, and their
golden fringe quite still against the white
cheeks. The faded rosebud on her bosom
did not stir: her heart had ceased beating.</p>

<p>It was the loveliest, sweetest, saddest
sight. Papa wept, and wrung his hands;
but there were no tears in mamma’s eyes as
she knelt beside her darling.</p>

<p>“O God! she isn’t dead yet; don’t let her
die! She isn’t dead yet; don’t let her die!”</p>

<p>That was what mamma said again and
again, with her hand upon Posy’s heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lemme kiss her! She’s <i>my</i> twin-sister,”
cried frantic Pollio, springing away from
Nanty, who tried to hold him. “I shall die
if you don’t lemme kiss her.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered his mother, with a
wonderful light in her eyes, “her heart
flutters! Go away, everybody: leave her
to papa and me.”</p>

<p>That was the end of sorrow, the beginning
of joy. Posy opened her beautiful
eyes: God let her live, and not die.</p>

<p>It was a happy, happy house; but was
any one happier than Pollio when they
brought him in, and told him he might kiss
her on her white lips?</p>

<p>“I tried to take care of her,” sobbed the
brave boy; “but the boat went and busted
right up, and <i>I</i> couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure you couldn’t, my little man:
we all know you did your best,” replied
papa, not laughing at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he picked up something from the
floor, and gave it to his wife, saying,—</p>

<p>“Let us always keep this precious token.”</p>

<p>It was Posy’s rosebud.</p>

<p>They did not know till next day that
Hop-clover had been in the kitchen all the
while, waiting for news from Posy.</p>

<p>“The child has a feeling heart,” said Jane
Roarty; “and so you’d ha’ thought, Miss
Pitcher, if you’d seen her cry in my arms
last night.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>GOING VISITING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day after Posy was quite well, she
sat by the roadside near the house, moulding
doll’s furniture out of clay. A little soft
chair about as big as a grasshopper stood
drying on a board, and she was now making
a sofa, and embroidering the sides with a
pin.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Pollio, “see who’s coming!”</p>

<p>It was dear Mr. Littlefield on horseback,
stopping every now and then to pick a fly
off his sleek horse. The children could not
hear him; but he was saying to the horse,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“There now, keep thy temper, good beast:
I won’t let the flies bite thee.”</p>

<p>But he was too kind to kill the flies; and
what do you suppose he did with them?
Dropped them tenderly into his coat-pocket!</p>

<p>Before he reached Judge Pitcher’s the
three children rushed out to meet him.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Edward, and Napoleon
and Josephine,” said he, as they alighted on
him like a flock of birds. “Is thy mother
well, and about the house? There now, I
must hurry and let out my prisoners.”</p>

<p>The children followed him into the stable,
where he opened his coat-pockets, and out
jumped a handful of dizzy, crazy flies.</p>

<p>“I’ve kept them in jail, where they
couldn’t do any mischief,” laughed the
Quaker; “but now they can get an honest
living in your stable, and not trouble anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Pollio and Posy laughed aloud at
this, and, seizing their tender-hearted old
friend by the arms, led him into the house
through the kitchen. Eliza looked up very
pleasantly, for she knew Friend Littlefield
and liked him; but she was in the act of
doing something which made him unhappy.
Some flies had settled on the table to sip a
few drops of molasses, and she was pouncing
down on them with a wet towel.</p>

<p>“Eliza, Eliza,” said he sorrowfully,
“those are God’s creatures. Consider!
<i>Thee</i> can’t make a fly!”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure I shouldn’t want to,” said
Eliza, with another dash of the towel. “I’m
sorry you feel so, sir; but I’ve no notion of
being turned out of the house by an army
of flies.”</p>

<p>Mr. Littlefield sighed, and Pollio drew
him along to the parlor. There were no flies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
there; and the room was so beautiful with
pictures and flowers, that the good man
smiled, and forgot Eliza’s cruelty. He took
Posy on his knee, and talked to her mother
about the dreadful accident to the steamboat,
and thanked God again and again that
the little girl was saved.</p>

<p>“How did thee feel when the boat blew
up, Napoleon?”</p>

<p>“I thought I was a <i>gone man</i>,” replied
Pollio; “and, I tell you, I tried hard to keep
the children still.”</p>

<p>This was so droll, that everybody laughed.
By and by the Quaker told Mrs. Pitcher he
had come to Rosewood to take home a new
“chaise,” and he had just happened to think
that this would be a good time for the twins
to pay him a visit. He could take them as
well as not, and his wife Liddy was sure to
be glad to see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Pollio began to turn a somerset, but
caught himself by the hair, and changed it
into a dance. Posy was quite as eager, but
did not dance with any thing but her eyes.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” said their mamma.
“Mr. Littlefield is very kind to give this
invitation; but the truth is, my poor little
Posy has nothing fit to wear. The cow has
eaten up her two best dresses.”</p>

<p>The Quaker looked surprised, as well he
might. He knew that toads eat their own
clothes, but he had never heard that any
animals eat little girls’ dresses.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pitcher, “our new cow
strayed into the clothes-yard last Monday,
and chewed up some of the fine clothes lying
in a tub. We would not have bought such
a strange cow if we had known her habits.”</p>

<p>“O mamma!” pleaded Posy in a whisper.
“Don’t you s’pose the lady would ’scuse it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
My other dresses are not <i>very</i> homely,—not
so homely as Hop-clover’s.”</p>

<p>“Hop-clover!” exclaimed Pollio aloud.
“Why, when the cow has chewed Posy’s
things all up, they look better’n Hop-clover’s.
Hop-clover’s things are <i>all</i> rags.”</p>

<p>“Is Hop-clover the cow?” asked the
Quaker.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir! It’s a little girl. And that
isn’t her name, either. Her name is—What
is her name, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Lucinda Outhouse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I knew ’twas a shed, or some
kind of a barn. Her name’s Lucy-vindy
Outhouse.”</p>

<p>“Outhouse, Outhouse!” exclaimed the
Quaker. “I never knew but one man of
that name; and he married a good friend of
mine,—Lucinda Fearing. But they went
to Ohio. This can’t be Lucinda’s child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, perhaps it is. We will send for
Hop-clover, and you shall talk with her,”
said Mrs. Pitcher, looking very much interested.</p>

<p>“How glad I <i>should</i> be if it is Lucinda’s
child! Liddy and I thought so much of
Lucinda!”</p>

<p>“She’s lame. Posy used to call her a
<i>hypocrite</i>,” said Teddy. Whereupon Posy
blushed, and hid behind her mother.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl! So she is lame? I’m
sorry,” said the kind Quaker, looking sober,
though he had never heard of Hop-clover
before. He seemed to forget that he had
invited company; and, without waiting to
hear whether they could go or not, he kept
on asking questions about the lame girl.</p>

<p>When he heard her mother was dead, he
sighed, and said, “Poor thing, poor thing!”
And, when he heard she lived alone with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
bad step-father, he wiped his spectacles, as if
this touched him far more than Eliza’s killing
flies.</p>

<p>“Did thee say I could see the child?”</p>

<p>“Pollio!” said his mother.</p>

<p>Pollio was always ready to run for his hat,
but just now he was lost in surprise. <i>Were</i>
he and Posy to be cheated out of their visit?
He started at once, however, to go after
“Lucy-vindy.”</p>

<p>You never saw a worse looking house than
the one she lived in. The windows were
half glass, half rags: outside stood a tub, a
rake with one or two stumpy teeth, an old
mop, and a battered tin pail. Hop-clover
was seated on the doorstep, mending the
skirt of her dress with some blue cotton
yarn drawn through a darning-needle. She
had never been taught to sew, and was wearing
her brass thimble on the wrong finger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Pollio did not know that; but he thought it
was funny to use such a monstrous needle,
and jerk so hard to get it through the calico.</p>

<p>“What you doing?” said he, leaning over
to watch her.</p>

<p>“Oh! the holes are awful: I want to
pucker ’em up a little,” replied Hop-clover,
pulling with such a jerk that she scratched
Pollio’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!” said she. But it was
a mercy she had not put out his eyes.</p>

<p>“Poh! it don’t hurt much: it isn’t as bad
as a butcher-knife,” said he, spreading the
blood over his cheek, as he rubbed the
scratch with his finger. “But, Hop-clover, I
want you to go to my house: there’s a man
wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“Wants to see <i>me!</i>”</p>

<p>Hop-clover’s eyes were big with wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes. Come, hurry; for Posy and I are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
going to ride in his chaise,—I guess; and I
never saw a chaise.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait, till I put on my good dress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come along! Your dresses are all
just alike.”</p>

<p>“Why, Pollio! I’ve got a pink one that’s
most whole.”</p>

<p>And she hopped joyfully into the house to
put it on. I suppose it <i>had</i> been pink when
Edith Pitcher owned it; but Hop-clover had
let it lie on the grass so many days and
nights, that it was faded and spotted and
streaked. Poor child! When people gave
her any thing, she did not know how to take
care of it.</p>

<p>Pollio thought she was a long while getting
ready. He stood on the doorstone whistling,
while she scrubbed her face and neck, and
smoothed her hair with a comb which had
about nine teeth in it. By the time she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
out he was cross; but she did not know it.
She was thinking how nice it was that somebody
“wanted her,” somebody had “sent”
for her.</p>

<p>The Quaker kissed her when he saw her.
Perhaps she was cleaner and prettier than he
had expected; for he kept saying, “Thee
looks like a good little girl, a nice little girl.
So thee has no mother? How long has she
been dead?”</p>

<p>Hop-clover did not know; but Mrs. Pitcher
said two years. She did not live very long
after the family came to Rosewood.</p>

<p>“Where did thee move from when thee
came here, my child?”</p>

<p>“We moved from Ohio.”</p>

<p>“This <i>must</i> be Lucinda Fearing’s child,”
said Mr. Littlefield, rising and sitting down
again. “Does thee remember how thy
mother looked, my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“She had black curls. Oh, I remember
her <i>so</i> well! She used to say thee and thou
to me sometimes, just as you do.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that was <i>our</i> Lucinda! I’m so glad
I have found her little girl!” said the Quaker,
walking about the room, then stooping
to kiss Hop-clover again.</p>

<p>“How would thee like to ride with me to
my house this afternoon for a visit?”</p>

<p>Hop-clover looked at the carpet as if a star
had fallen out of the sky at her feet. She
never once thought of her gown; though it
had stains and grease-spots, and a hole under
each arm. She forgot her leaky shoes, and
her coarse old shawl. What did she care
about her clothes if for once in her life she
could take a ride out of town!</p>

<p>She threw back her hat with such a look
of delight, that Nunky drew a hasty picture
of her, as he stood in the door with sketch-book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and pencil in his hand. Everybody was
glad for Hop-clover—I mean everybody but
the twins.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s mean,” said the injured
Pollio to his injured sister, as they stole out
of the room, and stood in the front-hall, with
their arms around each other’s waists, “asking
<i>her</i> to go instead of us!”</p>

<p>“So I think! If the cow did eat up my
white dresses, how did <i>he</i> know I wasn’t
a-going to go in my blue dress that the cow
<i>didn’t</i> eat!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Posy! And how’d he know <i>I</i>
wouldn’t go? Mamma never said ‘no’ about
<i>that;</i> for the cow didn’t eat up <i>my</i> clothes,
’cept my handkerjiff with ships in the
corner.”</p>

<p>The good Quaker would have been quite
surprised if he had overheard these remarks,
for he had no idea of leaving his little pets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
behind. What he called his “chaise” was a
large, handsome carriage with two seats; and,
when the children were snuggled into it that
afternoon, Pollio declared there was room
enough for three more and the dog.</p>

<p>The serene old Quaker chirruped to his
serene old horse, while the children shouted
“Good-by, everybody!” and jumped up and
down to try the new velvet cushions. And
then the gay little party drove off.</p>

<p>Hop-clover wore Edith’s outgrown blue
cambric dress, tucked up and taken in, and
Posy’s second-best hat, and looked as respectable
as any child in town.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad I’m lame!” thought she;
“for that’s what makes everybody love me.”</p>

<p>Was it? Then why didn’t people love
Jake Flint, a lying, stealing little boy in
Rosewood, who was as lame twice over as
Hop-clover?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>QUAKER MEETING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a lovely ride of twenty miles the
carriage stopped at a large yellow farm-house
in the midst of trees and flowers. Hop-clover
hoped this was Mr. Littlefield’s home; for it
looked like just the place where she would
wish to go visiting.</p>

<p>They drove round to a side-door. A girl
was seated in the entry with her lap full of
silver, which she was polishing with all the
strength of her big, strong arm.</p>

<p>“How does thee do, Dorothy? Where’s
my wife? I’ve brought her some company,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
said the Quaker, smiling as he handed out
the three children.</p>

<p>The girl rose, slipped off her apron, and
rolled the silver into it in a heap on the floor.
There were six visitors in the house already,
who had come since Mr. Littlefield went
away; but Dorothy was not like Eliza Potter,
she did not know how to be cross. She
asked Hop-clover if her foot was “asleep;”
but, when she found the little girl was lame,
she seemed very sorry. Then she led the
children into the parlor to her mistress; while
Mr. Littlefield drove into the stable with his
man John, to put up the carriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Littlefield was a lovely little lady, in
a drab silk dress and fine white cap, with a
white kerchief crossed upon her bosom.
She was seated with her guests, four Quaker
ladies, who also wore white caps and kerchiefs.
She rose when the children entered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and said with a kind smile that she was very
glad they had come. But I am sure she
wondered where her husband had picked
them up; for she had never seen one of
them before.</p>

<p>Hop-clover was quite alarmed by the row
of Quakers, but she did nothing worse than
to put her finger in her mouth; while Posy
blushed crimson, and Pollio bowed five
times,—once for each lady,—not forgetting
to twitch his front-hair. He had never seen
women dressed so strangely before; but he
wished them to understand that he thought
none the worse of them for it.</p>

<p>When Mr. Littlefield came in and said the
twins were Judge Pitcher’s children, his wife
kissed them again, and said she had always
wanted to see them.</p>

<p>“And thee wants to see this one just as
much, when I tell thee who she is,” said her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
husband, leading up Hop-clover. “This is
Lucinda Fearing’s child.”</p>

<p>“What? Thee doesn’t mean <i>our</i> Lucinda,—the
one that came to us when our little
grandchild Samuel was born, and lived here
five years?” said Mrs. Littlefield, taking
Hop-clover in her arms, and hugging her
right against the starched kerchief. “Bless
thy little heart! Why, thee looks like thy
mother!”</p>

<p>“I knew thee would be glad to see her,
Liddy,” said Mr. Littlefield, smiling.</p>

<p>The Quaker ladies all looked on with the
kindest interest, and said they remembered
“that good Lucinda.”</p>

<p>“She made my caps for me,” said Mrs.
Mott.</p>

<p>“She was very steady about going to
meeting,” said Mrs. Swan.</p>

<p>“Didn’t she marry a man by the name
of Outhouse?” asked Mrs. Crane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Hop-clover pressed her cheek against the
soft kerchief, and felt so happy that she
couldn’t help crying. It was beautiful to
see people who had known and loved her
own dear mother.</p>

<p>“This child looks very pale,” said Mr.
Littlefield; “but I thought it might do her
good to play with the calves and chickens
awhile. What does <i>thee</i> think, Liddy?”</p>

<p>The twins looked on, and listened to all
this with surprise. Hop-clover was almost
a little beggar-child; yet the people in this
house seemed to care more about her than
they did about Judge Pitcher’s children.
Posy was glad of it; but Pollio didn’t
quite like it, he was used to a great deal
of attention. Supper was now ready, however,—the
very nicest supper; and, Mr.
Swan and Mr. Crane coming in, no more
was said about “that good Lucinda.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning the children made a telegraph
in the barn with the clothes-line, and
sent printed messages back and forth, making
a clicking noise with two sticks while
they were going. Hop-clover did not print,
like the others, but wrote remarkably well
for a child of her age. This was her message:
“Click, Click. <i>Dorrythe</i> is coming
out here.”</p>

<p>And, before the message had gone “across
the wires,” Dorothy really did appear, with a
bowl of corn-meal dough; and the children
clustered around to see her feed the late
chickens. It was a pretty sight, especially
to Hop-clover.</p>

<p>“<i>You’re</i> having a good time, I guess,”
said Dorothy, smiling down upon the lame
girl kindly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I never was so happy! I never saw
such cunning chickens! But don’t you wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
they’d been born sooner? I’m afraid they
won’t grow up before the snow comes.”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t, unless we take good care
of them. But this is a famous place for
taking care of every thing,—chickens and
folks too,” added Dorothy, smiling again.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say thee and thou?”
asked Pollio, who had been watching the
girl’s speech.</p>

<p>“Because I’m not a Quaker.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like the Quakers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I love them dearly. I’ve lived
with Mrs. Littlefield ever since I was twelve
years old. She took me when I didn’t know
much, and hadn’t any home or any parents,
and she has been a mother to me ever since.
The Littlefields like folks all the better for
being poor, or sick, or in trouble, <i>I</i> believe,”
said Dorothy, with another smile at Hop-clover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, that’s just like”—began Posy.</p>

<p>“Like Jesus Christ,” said Pollio.</p>

<p>“To be sure it is: they try to be like
Him.”</p>

<p>“Dorothy,” said Hop-clover, drawing near
the girl, and speaking low, “did you know
my mother?”</p>

<p>“No: she went away just before I came;
but I’ve always heard about her.”</p>

<p>“They say she was awful good,” said Pollio,
spattering dough rather spitefully: “what
did she do that was so nice?”</p>

<p>“Well, she went to meeting pretty steady,
I guess, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“Poh, so does <i>my</i> mother: she goes every
Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Quakers go oftener than that: they go
every Thursday. They call Sunday First
Day, and Thursday Fifth Day.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go to Quaker meeting, ’cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
my mother used to,” said Hop-clover thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you can: there will be
meeting to-day, and all our folks will go
but the hired men,” said Dorothy, going into
the house with her empty bowl.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Littlefield heard of Hop-clover’s
wish, she seemed pleased; and
Pollio said at once that he and Posy
wished to go too. He knew he could sit
as still in church as anybody, not even excepting
“Lucy-vindy’s” mother.</p>

<p>So they all went off together,—the eight
good Quakers in drab, and the three little
children in pink and blue. Hop-clover had
the place of honor; for she walked between
Mr. and Mrs. Littlefield, holding a hand of
each. She looked too gay for a Quaker
maiden; and so did Posy, for Posy wore a
pink frock and pink stockings, and swung a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
pink parasol. She knew she was looking
well, and that Pollio’s hat and jacket were
nice; and I fear she tossed her head a little,
as she whispered,—</p>

<p>“Don’t take hold of my hand, Pollio: it
isn’t <i>stylish!</i>”</p>

<p>Posy was a dear little girl; but Nanty and
Nunky had asked each other lately if she
wasn’t growing just the least bit vain.</p>

<p>The Quaker meeting-house was brown,
and not very pretty. It had no pulpit, but
the children did not know there was no
minister either. They went in and took
their seats, which had very high backs.
Pollio sat with Mr. Littlefield, on the men’s
side; and Hop-clover and Posy were wedged
in between Mrs. Swan and Mrs. Crane, on
the women’s side.</p>

<p>They waited and waited for the minister,
but he didn’t come. They waited and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
waited for the music, but nobody sang.
Then Pollio observed that the “other men”
wore their hats: so he put his on again, and
peeped roguishly across the aisle at the little
girls, who peeped back again, and tried not
to smile.</p>

<p>Then they waited longer, and watched the
flies, and wondered why meeting didn’t
begin.</p>

<p>Meeting <i>had</i> begun. These good people,
with their hats and bonnets on, were talking
to God; and that is what they call a Quaker
meeting. Perhaps somebody would speak
by and by, perhaps not; but, at any rate, it
was a Quaker meeting all the same.</p>

<p>It was so warm, and so still, that Pollio
fell asleep, but was wakened by hearing a
sing-song voice say,—</p>

<p>“‘While I mused, the fire burned.’”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Littlefield. Pollio half rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on his toes, and stared at the stove. Where
<i>was</i> the fire?</p>

<p>But Mr. Littlefield meant the “fire of
love.” He loved God and all God’s children;
and what he said was very beautiful,
only Pollio could not quite understand it.</p>

<p>Then he sat down again, and sat so still,
that one fly washed its face on his hand, and
another walked over his nose and peeped at
his eyes, as if to see if he was asleep.</p>

<p>This was too much for Pollio. Perhaps
they were Quaker flies, and had come out
of Mr. Littlefield’s pocket; and, when he
thought of that, he giggled outright.</p>

<p>It was too bad, for he was generally a
very well-behaved boy in church. He could
not believe his own ears. Posy could not
believe hers, either, though she blushed crimson,
and hid behind Hop-clover. If he had
only waited one minute! The Quakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
were shaking hands all round for good-by:
Quaker meeting was done!</p>

<p>Pollio rushed out in an agony of shame;
but Mr. Littlefield stopped him in the entry,
by laying his hand kindly on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I suppose thee got pretty tired, Napoleon.
Thee isn’t used to our kind of
meetings.”</p>

<p>Oh, to think the man should speak to him
again! Pollio had supposed he was too bad
to be noticed.</p>

<p>Posy peeped up at him from under her
parasol, and he saw her face was covered
with blushes. Hop-clover gave him a pitying
look as she walked off with Mr. and
Mrs. Littlefield; and Pollio knew she never
would say again she wished she had a
brother like him.</p>

<p>I suppose he turned fifty somersets after
dinner. He always turned them when he
was happy, and still more when he was sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is something about that little boy
that makes me want to laugh,” said Dorothy
to John. “I don’t know whether it’s his
straight hair, or his black eyes, or the way
he has of standing on his head.”</p>

<p>“He is the <i>limberest</i> little chap I ever
saw,” said John: “and I can’t keep my face
straight when he quirks himself up in such
shapes; but I wish I could, for he is a great
rogue, and bothers me by meddling.”</p>

<p>The next John saw of Pollio he was
dangling from the hub of one of the new
carriage-wheels, like a young monkey.</p>

<p>“Come away from there, youngster! you
mustn’t meddle with that carriage,” said
John rather sharply, trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>Pollio had never heard the word “youngster”
before, and thought it did not sound
very respectful as addressed to the son of
Judge Pitcher. Perhaps it had something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to do with his laughing in meeting. Oh, of
course! He dropped lightly on the barn-floor;
but his lip curled, and there was a
spark in his eye that meant mischief. The
moment John’s back was turned, he was
climbing the wheel, “hand over hand,” into
the carriage.</p>

<p>“O Pollio, get right down!” cried Posy.
“You know what John said.”</p>

<p>“Who’s John? He’s no business with
<i>me!</i>” said Pollio, turning a somerset on the
back-seat.</p>

<p>“O Hop-clover! mustn’t he get down?”</p>

<p>“Of course he must,” replied Hop-clover,
chewing some wheat she had found in a
barrel.</p>

<p>“Tell you what it is!” said Pollio, dancing
up and down, “if Mr. Littlefield had a
boy, my father’d let him play in <i>our</i> carriage
as easy as nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Ike wouldn’t,” returned Posy.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it about Ike, and I can’t help
it about John: I guess Mr. Littlefield wants
to be polite to his company,” said Pollio,
cracking the whip.</p>

<p>The little girls had to run away for fear
of being hit. It troubled them to see Pollio
climb the wheels, and walk on the thills;
but, the more they begged, the more he was
determined to have his own way.</p>

<p>“Oh, what little cowards! ’Fraid of a
whip, and ’fraid of a carriage without any
horse! See me now! I can turn a somerset
right on the wheel!”</p>

<p>Whether he would have tried to do it and
broken his neck, I can’t say; for, as he was
prancing up and down on the thill, he was
stopped suddenly by a crackling noise, as if
wood was splitting in two. He knew what
it was: he had broken the thill!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>His brown face turned almost white as he
slipped back into the carriage.</p>

<p>“‘O boys! carry me ’long,’” sang he in
a husky voice, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The girls had not heard the noise, for
they had been screaming to him not to
turn a somerset on the wheel.</p>

<p>“‘O boys! carry me ’long.’ ‘Swing low,
sweet chariot!’” said pale, guilty Pollio,
scrambling slowly down from the carriage.
“Let’s go find some eggs.”</p>

<p>What would he have given now if it were
this forenoon instead of this afternoon!
What would he have given if he had obeyed
John, and not broken the beautiful new
carriage, and disgraced himself forever!</p>

<p>But need anybody know he had broken
it? John was coming back with the colts;
and, as Pollio saw him, he plunged headlong
into a barrel of straw. John laughed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
thought that was a boy’s way of hunting for
eggs. He did not suppose Pollio had
climbed into the carriage at all.</p>

<p>“Glad I got out before he came,” thought
Pollio, his heart beating fast.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>POLLIO MAKES UP HIS MIND.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Pollio’s conscience was not easy. He
danced about as if the barn-floor were covered
with thistles and every step hurt him.
As he flew from barrel to hay-mow, and from
hay-mow to hogshead, he kept talking to
himself in this way:—</p>

<p>“Poh! what do I care? Smart carriage to
break so easy as that! My papa wouldn’t
keep one ’thout it was strong enough to
jump on. What do <i>I</i> care?”</p>

<p>But he did care: he cared a great deal.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I can’t find any eggs,” said
Posy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>That roused him for a moment; and he
lifted his head from a barrel long enough to
say,—</p>

<p>“Why, I meant to told you, Dorothy
came out ever so long ago and <i>got</i> the eggs.”</p>

<p>“Did she? Well, what are you hunting
for, then? How queer you do act!” said
Hop-clover, as Pollio danced along to the
cow’s stall, and peeped in at nothing.</p>

<p>But the boy did not hear her; he was
thinking:—</p>

<p>“A new carriage too! We are going to
ride home in it to-morrow. Yes, that’s the
carriage we are going to ride home in. Got
to be mended. What’ll Mr. Littlefield
think?”</p>

<p>Here Pollio danced along on thistles to
the colt’s crib.</p>

<p>“There’s that colt. Perhaps Mr. Littlefield
will think the colt got in where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
carriage is, and chewed the thill.—<i>Could</i> he
chew the thill?</p>

<p>“No: Mr. Littlefield would know better
than that. Well, p’rhaps the dog broke it.—<i>Could</i>
the dog break it?”</p>

<p>Pollio reflected on <i>that</i> for a while.
Towzer was not as heavy as Beppo. No,
Towzer couldn’t break a thill: Mr. Littlefield
would know better than that.</p>

<p>“Well, p’rhaps the hens roosted on the
thill, and broke it.”</p>

<p>This was such a silly idea, that Pollio
shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“He don’t hear one word we say,” remarked
Posy to Hop-clover, after they had
asked him half a dozen questions, and received
no answer. “He has felt real bad
ever since he laughed in meeting. I ’spect
he’s afraid Teddy will hear of it; but <i>I</i>
sha’n’t tell.—Look up here, Pollio: don’t
you be afraid. <i>I</i> sha’n’t tell Teddy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Pollio made no reply even to this. The
two little girls gave him up then, and went
to keeping house very cosily in the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what Mr. Littlefield
<i>will</i> think,” pursued the unhappy boy. “But
he won’t think ’twas <i>me;</i> for nobody saw me
but the girls, and <i>they</i> didn’t hear it crack.
I’m <i>so</i> glad they didn’t hear it crack!”</p>

<p>By this time it seemed as if he could not
possibly stay in the barn another minute.
The more he thought about the carriage, the
worse he felt.</p>

<p>“Come, girls, let’s go somewhere else,”
said he, rushing out with a sort of war-whoop.</p>

<p>The girls were having a very interesting
time, nursing some ears of corn through the
“yellow-fever;” but at Pollio’s call they
deserted their poor sick children, and followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
him. He led them a very roundabout
chase, never stopping long enough to look at
any thing, or to let them have any sort of a
good time.</p>

<p>He was trying to run away from something.
What was it?</p>

<p>From <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>But, quick as his legs were, they were not
quick enough for that. Pollio Pitcher was
<i>always</i> close behind him: he couldn’t get
away from Pollio Pitcher.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I never saw him act so,”
said Hop-clover, puffing for breath as he
darted off, and rolled over and over in the
grass. “I’m getting real lame, running
round so long; and I’m afraid we sha’n’t get
back before supper.”</p>

<p>You must pardon Hop-clover for thinking
a good deal about her supper. Perhaps you
would think as much about it as she did, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
you were in the habit of feeling hungry half
the time.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll go back now if Pollio will,”
said Posy, though she wanted to pick
flowers. “Come, Pollio.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go ’long! I’ll come when I get
ready,” said he, climbing a tree, and dangling
from a limb.</p>

<p>They went; and, the moment they were
out of hearing, he began to make strange
noises,—hooting, barking, crowing, groaning.
He thought it would be some relief,
but it wasn’t: there was only one way to
obtain relief, and that was to tell Mr. Littlefield
the truth.</p>

<p>“What, tell him I broke his chaise? I
needn’t, and I sha’n’t! He won’t like me
any more if I do. He doesn’t like me much
now, ’cause I laughed in meeting.”</p>

<p>Pollio writhed and twisted. If the squirrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and tree-toads had stopped to watch
him, they would have thought he was crazy.
He talked aloud too; but he spoke his bad
thoughts, and kept his good thoughts to himself.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell! Catch me telling! Do I
want him to think my father’s got a
‘youngster’ for a boy?”</p>

<p>Then he pulled up a tuft of grass, and
threw it at a toad.</p>

<p>But, all the while, the other half of his
thoughts was good. The angels knew it; for
they had charge of Pollio. If you had been
there, you couldn’t have heard the still small
voice, deep down in his soul, saying,—</p>

<p>“Think I’d be so mean as <i>not</i> to tell?”</p>

<p>But the angels heard it, and smiled.
They knew it was hard work for the little
fellow to make up his mind, and that was
why he scolded and scowled. Mr. Littlefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
was fond of him, and Pollio liked to be
liked. It did require courage this time to
tell the truth and be despised. Of course
the good Quaker would say,—</p>

<p>“Well, Napoleon, if this is the way thee
behaves, I don’t want thee to come to my
house visiting again.”</p>

<p>Ah, well! but you needn’t think Pollio
wasn’t going to walk up to his duty like a
man. What is the use of a father and
mother, and uncle and aunt, to tell you what
is right, if you won’t do it? He wasn’t a
coward and a liar: if he had been, I
wouldn’t have written this story about him;
but I must confess a snail could have walked
faster than he did going back to the house.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Napoleon! Thee came
pretty near losing thy supper,” said Mr.
Littlefield, smiling, as Pollio came slowly
toward him, and pulled him by the sleeve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Supper! Why, his throat was so full of
lumps that a crumb would have choked him!
Not a word could he speak as he dragged
his friend along to the stable.</p>

<p>The worst was over now; for, the moment
Mr. Littlefield saw the broken carriage, he
knew the whole story.</p>

<p>I cannot say he wasn’t vexed. Pollio had
proved more troublesome than he had expected,—chasing
the cows, putting the
wheelbarrow, rake, and hoe out of place,
and now meddling with this new carriage.</p>

<p>But Friend Littlefield knew how to rule
his own spirit: he would not speak a word
when he was angry. Instead of speaking,
he waited, and looked at Pollio, who was
trying to double himself into a hard knot.
The sight of the child’s misery moved him
to pity; of course it did, for Mr. Littlefield
couldn’t bear to see even a fly unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Napoleon: so my new carriage is
broken. Who broke it?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Jumping.”</p>

<p>“Did John see thee?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did anybody else see thee?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then what made thee come and tell?”</p>

<p>“’Cause—’cause”—</p>

<p>“Did thee do it <i>because it was right?</i>”</p>

<p>The tone was so gentle, that Pollio ventured
to look up; and the old gentleman
was beaming down on him so kindly, that
he couldn’t bear it another minute.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m <i>so</i> sorry!” sobbed he, throwing
both arms round one of the Quaker’s knees.</p>

<p>“Sorry for what? Sorry thee told?”</p>

<p>“<i>No, sir!</i> I wouldn’t have <i>not</i> told for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
any thing in this world!” cried Pollio, hunting
for his handkerchief.</p>

<p>But, before he had found it,—and of
course it wasn’t in his pocket, for he had
thrown it at a tree-toad,—Mr. Littlefield
had caught him up in his arms, and was
giving him a good hugging.</p>

<p>“Thee is one of the Lord’s own little
ones,” said he, kissing him on both cheeks.
“Thee didn’t do right to meddle with my
chaise,—I won’t uphold thee in that,—but
thee did nobly to tell the truth. The Lord
bless thee and keep thee! Why, Napoleon,
I never liked thee half so well as I do this
minute!”</p>

<p>How did Pollio feel then? I suppose he
never was so surprised in his life. The
Quaker had to give him the use of his handkerchief
for about two minutes; and after
that the shower cleared off, and a rainbow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
shone in his eyes. The lumps had gone out
of his throat, the ache had gone out of his
heart, and the whole world looked so beautiful,
that he wanted to shout and turn somersets
all the way to the house.</p>

<p>Such a supper! Why, Mrs. Littlefield
had warm biscuits and honey, just as if she
knew they were the very things Pollio liked
best. And after tea Mr. Littlefield took him
on his knee, and told him a bear-story, which
was so funny that I wish I could tell it
myself, only I can’t make you laugh as the
Quaker would have done.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<div class='center'>“THE CUB THAT WAS WHIPPED.</div>

<p>“Once a man was out hunting; and, as
he was climbing a steep hill, he met a little
cub. He thought maybe it had no father
and mother, and he would like to carry it
home. But, when he took it up in his arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the cub cried out and made such a noise that
its mother heard it from the top of the hill,
and came tumbling down, heels over head,
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“The man dropped the cub in a moment,
and ran and hid behind a tree; for he had
left his gun in the valley, and dared not
meet the bear without it. He lay very still
while the bear hunted everywhere to see
what it was that had been troubling her cub.
He was <i>so</i> afraid she would find him! But
she could not smell him, for the wind was
the wrong way; and she could not see him,
for the tree hid him completely.</p>

<p>“At last she gave it up, and thought the
cub had been crying out for fun, and just to
tease her.</p>

<p>“But oh, she was so angry! And what
do you think she did to teach her child
better manners? She caught up that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cub, and whipped it as hard as she could
with her paw! The poor thing cried just
like a baby, and the man could not help
laughing as he lay there behind the tree.
He pitied the little creature, for it did not
deserve the whipping; but it certainly was
very funny.</p>

<p>“When the bear had punished it as long
as she thought proper, she growled as if to
say, ‘Don’t you ever let me know of your
doing this again;’ and then she and her
baby trotted off to their den, and the man
hurried home as fast as he could.”</p></div>

<p>Mr. Littlefield said this was a true story,
for the hunter had told it to him with his
own lips.</p>

<p>The rest of the visit was lovely. The
carriage was mended next morning, and in
the afternoon the children were to start for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
home. Hop-clover had one of the late chickens
in a little box of cotton-wool, and a cup
of dough with which to feed it on the way.
She thought she could keep the chicken in
the back-room at home, and, when the nights
grew colder, it should sleep with her in her
own bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>HOP-CLOVER’S HOME.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had just eaten dinner, and John
had not gone out as yet to harness the horse.</p>

<p>“Lucinda,” said Mrs. Littlefield as they
all went into the parlor, “hast thou had a
good visit here? Come and put thy arms
round my neck, and tell me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve had a <i>beautiful</i> time!” said little
Hop-clover with a sigh of joy; and then she
sighed again, to think she was going away to
her miserable home, and never, never, should
be so happy again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Littlefield looked at her husband;
and he came across the room, smiling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
put his arms around her and Hop-clover as
they stood together.</p>

<p>“My wife and I haven’t any little girl,”
said he. “How would thee like to come
and live with us, Lucinda?”</p>

<p>Now think of that! Hop-clover could not
speak for surprise and joy. Besides, she
couldn’t believe they meant what they said:
it was too good to be true.</p>

<p>“If thee would really like it, Lucinda,
thee don’t know how glad we should be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d rather live here than go to
heaven!” cried little Hop-clover as soon as
she could get her breath.</p>

<p>It pleased the dear old people very much
to see her so glad; and they both kissed her
at the same moment, while Pollio and Posy
looked on in surprise.</p>

<p>“But, Liddy,” said Mr. Littlefield to his
wife, “we can’t think of taking her unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
her father is willing. I will go to see him
when I get to Rosewood.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he isn’t my truly father: <i>he</i> don’t
care where I go,” said Hop-clover eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Littlefield thought, as she did, that he
wasn’t likely to care. If he had not thought
so, he would not have spoken to Hop-clover
about this until after he had seen him.</p>

<p>“Well, if he says we can have thee, then
thee can pack thy clothes, and come back
with me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was droll to talk about packing Hop-clover’s
“clothes.” Those she wore just
now were very good, but all the others were
fit for nothing but the rag-bag.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I sha’n’t need my chicken;
and you may have it,” said she to Pollio,
feeling like a crown-princess giving away a
casket of jewels. I suppose you have no
idea how very, very rich Hop-clover thought
herself all in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Napoleon, thee can keep the
chicken as a memento of this visit; and,
next time thee comes, thee shall have something
better,” said Mrs. Littlefield, smiling,
as Pollio danced about with the box.</p>

<p>The ride home was as pleasant as a fairy-story;
only Pollio couldn’t help looking at
the thill that had been mended, and thinking,—</p>

<p>“Mr. Littlefield was a jolly good man to
forgive me. Catch me meddling with any
of <i>his</i> things again!”</p>

<p>Hop-clover and little Posy chatted together
in a low voice on the back-seat.</p>

<p>“God did take care of you, didn’t he?”
said Posy.</p>

<p>“Oh! I always knew He would,” replied
Hop-clover with a joyous smile; “but I
didn’t s’pect he’d do any thing so nice as
<i>this</i>, you know!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>There wasn’t the least trouble about her
father’s giving her up. He said “Yes,” without
taking his pipe out of his mouth; and
then Mr. Littlefield left Hop-clover at the
little brown house to “pack up her things,”
while he drove to Judge Pitcher’s with the
twins.</p>

<p>“O mamma! she’s going to live with ’em,—live
with ’em always!” cried Posy, as
they rushed into the house.</p>

<p>And before Mrs. Pitcher could ask who
“she” was, and where she was going to live,
Pollio was swinging the peeping chicken
before her eyes, with a shout,—</p>

<p>“See what I’ve got for a <i>tormento</i>,
mamma!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Eliza will think it’s a <i>tormento</i>
if you keep it under the kitchen-stove,”
laughed aunt Ann.</p>

<p>It was not the fault of the twins if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
family did not hear what had happened to
Hop-clover. Posy ran to tell Jane, Jane
told Eliza, and Eliza told Ike. Then Nunky
came home from sketching in the glen; and
Pollio met him with the glad news before he
had turned the street-corner.</p>

<p>There was a great time of rejoicing. Mrs.
Pitcher set out the best china for supper, and
everybody drank Friend Littlefield’s health
in a cup of broma. After that, all the windows
were lighted in both parlors, and the
judge wheeled up the best chair for the
Quaker, while Nunky played “The Shepherd’s
Pipe upon the Mountain.”</p>

<p>A gay fire burned in the grate, for the
evening was chill: the pictures on the walls
seemed to smile, and so did the flowers in
the vases, and the flowers in the carpet.
Posy thought the room smiled all over, as
she sat on her papa’s knee, and listened to
the music, and thought of Hop-clover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it’s nice for little girls to live in
a home,” said she to herself, pressing her
cheek against her papa’s whiskers.</p>

<p>I could begin to-morrow morning, and tell
you ever so much more about her and Pollio,—how
new things happened to them day
after day, and year after year: but the
printer thinks my book is long enough already;
so I must stop this very evening,
before the fire burns low in the grate. If
you really care to hear more about Pollio
and Posy, perhaps, by and by, I will write
another book; but now we will drop a
courtsey, make a bow, and say,—</p>

<p>“Good-night, little Pitchers.”</p>

<p>“Another of those sweet, natural child-stories in which the heroine
does and says just such things as actual, live, flesh children do, is the
one before us. And what is still better, each incident points a moral.
The illustrations are a great addition to the delight of the youthful
reader. It is just such beautiful books as this which bring to our
minds, in severe contrast, the youth’s literature of our early days—the
good little boy who died young and the bad little boy who went
fishing on Sunday and died in prison, etc., etc., to the end of the
threadbare, improbable chapter.”—<i>Rural New Yorker.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kittyleen</span>—one of the Flaxie Frizzle series—is a genuinely
helpful as well as delightfully entertaining story. The nine-year-old
Flaxie is worried, beloved, and disciplined by a bewitching three-year-old
tormenter, whose accomplished mother allows her to prey upon
the neighbors. ‘Everybody felt the care of Mrs. Garland’s children.
There were six of them, and their mother was always painting china.
She did it beautifully, with graceful vines trailing over it, and golden
butterflies ready to alight on sprays of lovely flowers. Sometimes the
neighbors thought it would be a fine thing if she would keep her little
ones at home rather more; but, if she had done that, she could not
have painted china.’”—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>
